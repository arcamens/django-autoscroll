It is well that you should celebrate your Arbor Day thoughtfully, for within your lifetime the nation's need of trees will become serious. We of an older generation can get along with what we have, though with growing hardship; but in your full manhood and womanhood you will want what nature once so bountifully supplied and man so thoughtlessly destroyed; and because of that want you will reproach us, not for what we have used, but for what we have wasted.Â  ~Theodore Roosevelt, 1907 Arbor Day Message

Will urban sprawl spread so far that most people lose all touch with nature?Â  Will the day come when the only bird a typical American child ever sees is a canary in a pet shop window?Â  When the only wild animal he knows is a rat - glimpsed on a night drive through some city slum?Â  When the only tree he touches is the cleverly fabricated plastic evergreen that shades his gifts on Christmas morning?Â  ~Frank N. Ikard, North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference, Houston, March 1968

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are written by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
~Joyce Kilmer, "Trees," 1914

Only when the last tree has died and the last river been poisoned and the last fish been caught will we realise we cannot eat money.Â  ~Cree Indian Proverb

We are merely the stars' tennis-balls, struck and banded
Which way please them.
~John Webster, The Duchess of Malfi


This is the excellent foppery of the world, that when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits of our own behaviour) we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars: as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treacherous by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on.Â  An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star!Â  ~William Shakespeare


Anyone can be a millionaire, but to become a billionaire you need an astrologer.Â  ~John Pierpont Morgan

The vast majority, who believe in astrology and think that the planets have nothing better to do than form a code that will tell them whether tomorrow is a good day to close a business deal or not, become all the more excited and enthusiastic about the bilge when a group of astronomers denounces it.Â  ~Isaac Asimov


Astrologers are agreed that the squiggles called a horoscope contain some sort of message to be decoded...Â  ~Dennis Elwell


I know that astrology isn't a science... Of course it isn't.Â  It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis.... The rules just kind of got there.Â  They don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves.Â  But when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people.Â  In astrology the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make.Â  It's just a way of thinking about a problem which lets the shape of that problem begin to emerge.Â  The more rules, the tinier the rules, the more arbitrary they are, the better.Â  It's like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the hidden indentations are.Â  It lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above it that's now been taken away and hidden.Â  The graphite's not important.Â  It's just the means of revealing their indentations.Â  So you see, astrology's nothing to do with astronomy.Â  It's just to do with people thinking about people.Â  ~Douglas Adams, Mostly Harmless


The cosmos is a vast living body, of which we are still parts.Â  The sun is a great heart whose tremors run through our smallest veins.Â  The moon is a great nerve center from which we quiver forever.Â  Who knows the power that Saturn has over us, or Venus?Â  But it is a vital power, rippling exquisitely through us all the time.Â  ~D.H. Lawrence


Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars.Â  But they retain the power of wriggling, of fighting with their star or against it, and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle.Â  ~E.M. Forster


Astrology can clear up or mix up a person as much as any other psychological, philosophical or religious mirror, a looking glass in the endless mirror hall of life.Â  ~Markku Siivola


A mind is accustomed to mathematical deduction, when confronted with the faulty foundations of astrology, resists a long, long time, like an obstinate mule, until compelled by beating and curses to put its foot into that dirty puddle.Â  ~Johannes Kepler


Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter.Â  To begin: there's Aries, or the Ram - lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull - he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins - that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path - he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the virgin! that's our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales - happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in rear; we are curing the wound, when come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself.Â  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here's the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Waterbearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and, to wind up, with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.Â  ~Herman Melville

At the moment I am looking into astrology, which seems indispensable for a proper understanding of mythology.Â  There are strange and wondrous things in these lands of darkness.Â  Please, don't worry about my wanderings in these infinitudes.Â  I shall return laden with rich booty for our knowledge of the human psyche.Â  ~Carl Jung


Responsibility, n.Â  A detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one's neighbor.Â  In the days of astrology it was customary to unload it upon a star.Â  ~Ambrose Bierce


Astrology is a fact, in most instances.Â  But astrological aspects are but signs, symbols.Â  No influence is of greater value or of greater help than the will of an individual.... Do not attempt to be guided by, but use the astrological influences as the means to meet or to overcome the faults and failures, or to minimize the faults and to magnify the virtues in self.Â  ~Edgar Cayce


Astrology furnishes a splendid proof of the contemptible subjectivity of men.Â  It refers the course of celestial bodies to the miserable ego:Â  it establishes a connection between the comets in heaven and squabbles and rascalities on earth.Â  ~Arthur Schopenhauer


The puzzling thing is that there is really a curious coincidence between astrological and psychological facts, so that one can isolate time from the characteristics of an individual, and also, one can deduce characteristics from a certain time....Â  ~Carl Jung

On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.

O'Rourke

I see great things in baseball.Â  It's our game - the American game.Â  It will take our people out-of-doors, fill them with oxygen, give them a larger physical stoicism.Â  Tend to relieve us from being a nervous, dyspeptic set.Â  Repair these losses, and be a blessing to us.Â  ~Walt Whitman

When we played softball, I'd steal second base, feel guilty and go back.Â  ~Woody Allen

It's no coincidence that female interest in the sport of baseball has increased greatly since the ballplayers swapped those wonderful old-time baggy flannel uniforms for leotards.Â  ~Mike Royko

During my 18 years I came to bat almost 10,000 times.Â  I struck out about 1,700 times and walked maybe 1,800 times.Â  You figure a ballplayer will average about 500 at bats a season.Â  That means I played seven years without ever hitting the ball.Â  ~Mickey Mantle, 1970

A critic once characterized baseball as six minutes of action crammed into two-and-one-half hours.Â  ~Ray Fitzgerald, in Boston Glove, 1970


I don't know why people like the home run so much.Â  A home run is over as soon as it starts.... The triple is the most exciting play of the game.Â  A triple is like meeting a woman who excites you, spending the evening talking and getting more excited, then taking her home.Â  It drags on and on.Â  You're never sure how it's going to turn out.Â  ~George Foster, 1978


Baseball is a game dominated by vital ghosts; it's a fraternity, like no other we have of the active and the no longer so, the living and the dead.Â  ~Richard Gilman

My dad taught me to switch-hit.Â  He and my grandfather, who was left-handed, pitched to me everyday after school in the back yard.Â  I batted lefty against my dad and righty against my granddad.Â  ~Mickey Mantle


I don't love baseball.Â  I don't love most of today's players.Â  I don't love the owners.Â  I do love, however, the baseball that is in the heads of baseball fans.Â  I love the dreams of glory of 10-year-olds, the reminiscences of 70-year-olds.Â  The greatest baseball arena is in our heads, what we bring to the games, to the telecasts, to reading newspaper reports.Â  ~Stan Isaacs, "Diamond-Studded Memories," Newsday, 9 April 1990


Baseball is a harbor, a seclusion from failure that really matters, a playful utopia in which virtuosity can be savored to the third decimal place of a batting average.Â  ~Mark Kramer


Basketball, hockey and track meets are action heaped upon action, climax upon climax, until the onlooker's responses become deadened.Â  Baseball is for the leisurely afternoons of summer and for the unchanging dreams.Â  ~Roger Kahn

Baseball is reassuring.Â  It makes me feel as if the world is not going to blow up.Â  ~Sharon Olds, This Sporting Life, 1987


One of the chief duties of the fan is to engage in arguments with the man behind him.Â  This department of the game has been allowed to run down fearfully.Â  ~Robert Benchley


Though I like the various forms of football in the world, I don't think they begin to compare with these two great Anglo-Saxon ball games for sophisticated elegance and symbolism.Â  Baseball and cricket are beautiful and highly stylized medieval war substitutes, chess made flesh, a mixture of proud chivalry and base - in both senses - greed.Â  With football we are back to the monotonous clashing armor of the brontosaurus.Â  ~John Fowles

I believe in the Church of Baseball.Â  I tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones.Â  I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, trees, mushrooms and Isadora Duncan.Â  I know things.Â  For instance, there are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary and there are 108 stitches in a baseball.Â  When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance.Â  ~Ron Shelton, Bull Durham, 1988


The great thing about baseball is that there's a crisis every day.Â  ~Gabe Paul


I have discovered in twenty years of moving around a ball park, that the knowledge of the game is usually in inverse proportion to the price of the seats.Â  ~Bill Veeck


A game of great charm in the adoption of mathematical measurements to the timing of human movements, the exactitudes and adjustments of physical ability to hazardous chance.Â  The speed of the legs, the dexterity of the body, the grace of the swing, the elusiveness of the slide - these are the features that make Americans everywhere forget the last syllable of a man's last name or the pigmentation of his skin.Â  ~Branch Rickey, May 1960


I became a good pitcher when I stopped trying to make them miss the ball and started trying to make them hit it.Â  ~Sandy Koufax


Hitting is timing.Â  Pitching is upsetting timing.Â  ~Warren Spahn


Don't forget to swing hard, in case you hit the ball.Â  ~Woodie Held


Putting lights in Wrigley Field is like putting aluminum siding on the Sistine Chapel.Â  ~Roger Simon, 1988

Baseball is an island of activity amidst a sea of statistics.Â  ~Author Unknown


The greatest feeling in the world is to win a major league game.Â  The second-greatest feeling is to lose a major league game.Â  ~Chuck Tanner, quoted in The Sporting News, 15 July 1985


What we have are good gray ballplayers, playing a good gray game and reading the good gray Wall Street Journal.Â  They have been brainwashed, dry-cleaned and dehydrated!... Wake up the echoes at the Hall of Fame and you will find that baseball's immortals were a rowdy and raucous group of men who would climb down off their plaques and go rampaging through Cooperstown, taking spoils.... Deplore it if you will, but Grover Cleveland Alexander drunk was a better pitcher than Grover Cleveland Alexander sober.Â  ~Bill Veeck, The Hustler's Handbook

Spread the diaper in the position of the diamond with you at bat.Â  Then fold second base down to home and set the baby on the pitcher's mound.Â  Put first base and third together, bring up home plate and pin the three together.Â  Of course, in case of rain, you gotta call the game and start all over again.Â  ~Jimmy Piersal, on how to diaper a baby, 1968

It never ceases to amaze me how many of baseball's wounds are self-inflicted.Â  ~Bill Veeck, The Hustler's Handbook


A mystique of history and heritage surrounds the New York Yankees.Â  It's like the old days revived.Â  We're loved and hated, but always in larger doses than any other team.Â  We're the only team in any sport whose name and uniform and insignia are synonymous with their entire sport all over the world.... the Yankees mean baseball to more people than all the other teams combined.Â  ~Paul Blair, quoted in Washington Post, 22 June 1978


Hating the New York Yankees is as American as apple pie, unwed mothers and cheating on your income tax.Â  ~Mike Royko, 1981

Beauty and folly are generally companions.Â  ~Baltasar Gracian

May she be granted beauty and yet not
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
Being made beautiful overmuch,
Consider beauty a sufficient end,
Lose natural kindness and maybe
The heart-revealing intimacy
That chooses right, and never find a friend....
~William Butler Yeats, "A Prayer for my Daughter"

Beauty can be coaxed out of ugliness.Â  ~Dr.Â SunWolf, professorsunwolf.com

One summer night, out on a flat headland, all but surrounded by the waters of the bay, the horizons were remote and distant rims on the edge of space.Â  Millions of stars blazed in darkness, and on the far shore a few lights burned in cottages.Â  Otherwise there was no reminder of human life.Â  My companion and I were alone with the stars:Â  the misty river of the Milky Way flowing across the sky, the patterns of the constellations standing out bright and clear, a blazing planet low on the horizon.Â  It occurred to me that if this were a sight that could be seen only once in a century, this little headland would be thronged with spectators.Â  But it can be seen many scores of nights in any year, and so the lights burned in the cottages and the inhabitants probably gave not a thought to the beauty overhead; and because they could see it almost any night, perhaps they never will.Â  ~Rachel Carson

Flowers... are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world.Â  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1844

A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.Â  ~Walt Whitman

...[K]now that however ugly the parts appear the whole remains beautiful.Â  A severed hand

Organic wholeness, the wholeness of life and things, the divine beauty of the universe....
~Robinson Jeffers, from "The Answer"

Taking joy in living is a woman's best cosmetic.Â  ~Rosalind Russell

I hope you have lost your good looks, for while they last any fool can adore you, and the adoration of fools is bad for the soul.Â  No, give me a ruined complexion and a lost figure and sixteen chins on a farmyard of Crow's feet and an obvious wig.Â  Then you shall see me coming out strong.Â  ~George Bernard Shaw, to Mrs. Patrick Campbell

He does not believe who does not live according to his belief.Â  ~Thomas Fuller

When I believe in nothing I do not want to meet you when you believe in nothing.Â  ~Antonio Porchia, Voces, 1943, translated from Spanish by W.S. Merwin

Why should anyone steal a watch when he could steal a bicycle?Â  ~Flann O'Brien


The bicycle is the most civilized conveyance known to man.Â  Other forms of transport grow daily more nightmarish.Â  Only the bicycle remains pure in heart.Â  ~Iris Murdoch, The Red and the Green


When man invented the bicycle he reached the peak of his attainments.Â  Here was a machine of precision and balance for the convenience of man.Â  And (unlike subsequent inventions for man's convenience) the more he used it, the fitter his body became.Â  Here, for once, was a product of man's brain that was entirely beneficial to those who used it, and of no harm or irritation to others.Â  Progress should have stopped when man invented the bicycle.Â  ~Elizabeth West, Hovel in the Hills


When I see an adult on a bicycle, I do not despair for the future of the human race.Â  ~H.G. Wells


When I go biking, I repeat a mantra of the day's sensations:Â  bright sun, blue sky, warm breeze, blue jay's call, ice melting and so on.Â  This helps me transcend the traffic, ignore the clamorings of work, leave all the mind theaters behind and focus on nature instead.Â  I still must abide by the rules of the road, of biking, of gravity.Â  But I am mentally far away from civilization.Â  The world is breaking someone else's heart.Â  ~Diane Ackerman


For instance, the bicycle is the most efficient machine ever created:Â  Converting calories into gas, a bicycle gets the equivalent of three thousand miles per gallon.Â  ~Bill Strickland, The Quotable Cyclist


A bicycle does get you there and more.... And there is always the thin edge of danger to keep you alert and comfortably apprehensive.Â  Dogs become dogs again and snap at your raincoat; potholes become personal.Â  And getting there is all the fun.Â  ~Bill Emerson, "On Bicycling," Saturday Evening Post, 29 July 1967


[T]he bicycle will accomplish more for women's sensible dress than all the reform movements that have ever been waged.Â  ~Author Unknown, from Demerarest's Family Magazine, 1895

Melancholy is incompatible with bicycling.Â  ~James E. Starrs


The bicycle had, and still has, a humane, almost classical moderation in the kind of pleasure it offers.Â  It is the kind of machine that a Hellenistic Greek might have invented and ridden.Â  It does no violence to our normal reactions:Â  It does not pretend to free us from our normal environment.Â  ~J.B. Jackson


Until mountain biking came along, the bike scene was ruled by a small elite cadre of people who seemed allergic to enthusiasm.Â  ~Jacquie Phelan


I took care of my wheel as one would look after a Rolls Royce.Â  If it needed repairs I always brought it to the same shop on Myrtle Avenue run by a negro named Ed Perry.Â  He handled the bike with kid gloves, you might say.Â  He would always see to it that neither front nor back wheel wobbled.Â  Often he would do a job for me without pay, because, as he put it, he never saw a man so in love with his bike as I was.Â  ~Henry Miller, My Bike and Other Friends


Get a bicycle.Â  You will not regret it if you live.Â  ~Mark Twain, "Taming the Bicycle"


Cycling is unique.Â  No other sport lets you go like that - where there's only the bike left to hold you up.Â  If you ran as hard, you'd fall over.Â  Your legs wouldn't support you.Â  ~Steve Johnson


The hardest part of raising a child is teaching them to ride bicycles.Â  A shaky child on a bicycle for the first time needs both support and freedom.Â  The realization that this is what the child will always need can hit hard.Â  ~Sloan Wilson


Life is like riding a bicycle - in order to keep your balance, you must keep moving.Â  ~Albert Einstein


Mankind has invested more than four million years of evolution in the attempt to avoid physical exertion.Â  Now a group of backward-thinking atavists mounted on foot-powered pairs of Hula-Hoops would have us pumping our legs, gritting our teeth, and searing our lungs as though we were being chased across the Pleistocene savanna by saber-toothed tigers.Â  Think of the hopes, the dreams, the effort, the brilliance, the pure force of will that, over the eons, has gone into the creation of the Cadillac Coupe de Ville.Â  Bicycle riders would have us throw all this on the ash heap of history.Â  ~P.J. O'Rourke






After your first day of cycling, one dream is inevitable.Â  A memory of motion lingers in the muscles of your legs, and round and round they seem to go.Â  You ride through Dreamland on wonderful dream bicycles that change and grow.Â  ~H.G. Wells, The Wheels of Chance


Messengers and mountain bikers share a common chromosome.Â  ~James Bethea


If we all, mountain bikers, cyclists, multinational companies, Jo Public, respected the land like old civilizations we wouldn't get so many punctures.Â  Earth's revenge.Â  ~Jo BurtÂ  (Thanks, Jacquie)


The bicycle is the perfect transducer to match man's metabolic energy to the impedance of locomotion.Â  Equipped with this tool, man outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well.Â  ~Ivan Illich, Energy and Equity, 1974


It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them.Â  Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motor car only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.Â  ~Ernest Hemingway


Nothing compares to the simple pleasure of a bike ride.Â  ~John F. Kennedy


Cycle tracks will abound in Utopia.Â  ~H.G. Wells


It is curious that with the advent of the automobile and the airplane, the bicycle is still with us.Â  Perhaps people like the world they can see from a bike, or the air they breathe when they're out on a bike.Â  Or they like the bicycle's simplicity and the precision with which it is made.Â  Or because they like the feeling of being able to hurtle through air one minute, and saunter through a park the next, without leaving behind clouds of choking exhaust, without leaving behind so much as a footstep.Â  ~Gurdon S. Leete


The sound of a car door opening in front of you is similar to the sound of a gun being cocked.Â  ~Amy Webster


Bicycling is the nearest approximation I know to the flight of birds.Â  The airplane simply carries a man on its back like an obedient Pegasus; it gives him no wings of his own.Â  ~Louis J. Helle, Jr., Spring in Washington


There is nothing like walking to get the feel of a country.Â  A fine landscape is like a piece of music; it must be taken at the right tempo.Â  Even a bicycle goes too fast.Â  ~Paul Scott Mowrer, The House of Europe


You never have the wind with you - either it is against you or you're having a good day.Â  ~Daniel Behrman, The Man Who Loved Bicycles


I came out for exercise, gentle exercise, and to notice the scenery and to botanise.Â  And no sooner do I get on that accursed machine than off I go hammer and tongs; I never look to right or left, never notice a flower, never see a view - get hot, juicy, red - like a grilled chop.Â  Get me on that machine and I have to go.Â  I go scorching along the road, and cursing aloud at myself for doing it.Â  ~H.G. Wells, The Wheels of Chance


The secret to mountain biking is pretty simple.Â  The slower you go the more likely it is you'll crash.Â  ~Julie Furtado


Things look different from the seat of a bike carrying a sleeping bag with a cold beer tucked inside.Â  ~Jim Malusa


If you ride you know those moments when you have fed yourself into the traffic, felt the hashed-up asphalt rattle in the handlebars, held a lungful of air in a cloud of exhaust.Â  Up ahead there are two parallel buses.Â  With cat's whiskers, you measure the clearance down a doubtful alley.Â  You swing wide, outflank that flower truck.Â  The cross-street yellow light is turning red.Â  You burst off the green like a surfer on a wave of metal.Â  You have a hundred empty yards of Broadway to yourself.Â  ~Chip Brown, "A Bike and a Prayer"


All bicycles weigh fifty pounds.Â  A thirty-pound bicycle needs a twenty-pound lock.Â  A forty-pound bicycle needs a ten-pound lock.Â  A fifty-pound bicycle doesn't need a lock.Â  ~Author Unknown


Think of bicycles as rideable art that can just about save the world.Â  ~Grant Petersen


Most bicyclists in New York City obey instinct far more than they obey the traffic laws, which is to say that they run red lights, go the wrong way on one-way streets, violate cross-walks, and terrify innocents, because it just seems easier that way.Â  Cycling in the city, and particularly in midtown, is anarchy without malice.Â  ~Author unknown, from New Yorker, "Talk of the Town"

I use the word "fat."Â  I use that word because that's what people are: they're fat.Â  They're not bulky; they're not large, chunky, hefty or plump.Â  And they're not big-boned.Â  Dinosaurs were big-boned.Â  These people are not overweight: this term somehow implies there is some correct weight.Â  There is no correct weight.Â  Heavy is also a misleading term.Â  An aircraft carrier is heavy; it's not fat.Â  Only people are fat, and that's what fat people are!Â  They're fat!Â  ~George Carlin

Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature!Â  - ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more!Â  Is not nakedness then indecent?Â  No, not inherently.Â  It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability that is indecent.Â  There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.Â  Perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature has never been eligible (and how many thousands there are!) has not really known what purity is - nor what faith or art or health really is.Â  ~Walt Whitman

Where have those flowers and butterflies all gone
That science may have staked the future on?
He seems to say the reason why so much

As for butterflies, I can hardly conceive of one's attending upon you; but to question the congruence of the complement is vain, if it exists.Â  ~Marianne Moore, "To a Steam Roller"

We must remain as close to the flowers, the grass, and the butterflies as the child is who is not yet so much taller than they are.Â  We adults, on the other hand, have outgrown them and have to lower ourselves to stoop down to them.Â  It seems to me that the grass hates us when we confess our love for it.Â  Whoever would partake of all good things must understand how to be small at times.Â  ~Friedrich Nietzsche

Grown-ups love figures.Â  When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.Â  They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like?Â  What games does he love best?Â  Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand:Â  "How old is he?Â  How many brothers has he?Â  How much does he weigh?Â  How much money does his father make?"Â  Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.Â  ~Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, The Little Prince, 1943, translated from French

It is necessary to write, if the days are not to slip emptily by.Â  How else, indeed, to clap the net over the butterfly of the moment?Â  For the moment passes, it is forgotten; the mood is gone; life itself is gone.Â  That is where the writer scores over his fellows:Â  he catches the changes of his mind on the hop.Â  ~Vita Sackville-West

Cats are to dogs what modern people are to the people we used to have.Â  Cats are slimmer, cleaner, more attractive, disloyal, and lazy.Â  It's easy to understand why the cat has eclipsed the dog as modern America's favorite pet.Â  People like pets to possess the same qualities they do.Â  Cats are irresponsible and recognize no authority, yet are completely dependent on others for their material needs.Â  Cats cannot be made to do anything useful.Â  Cats are mean for the fun of it.Â  In fact, cats possess so many of the same qualities as some people (expensive girlfriends, for instance) that it's often hard to tell the people and the cats apart.Â  ~P.J. O'Rourke, Modern Manners

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there, lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid.Â  She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again, and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.Â  ~Mark Twain

I have noticed that what cats most appreciate in a human being is not the ability to produce food which they take for granted, but his or her entertainment value.Â  ~Author Unknown

The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it.Â  If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth:Â  if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.Â  ~John Stuart Mill, On Liberty, 1859

The populist authoritarianism that is the downside of political correctness means that anyone, sometimes it seems like everyone, can proclaim their grief and have it acknowledged.Â  The victim culture, every sufferer grasping for their own Holocaust, ensures that anyone who feels offended can call for moderation, for dilution, and in the end, as is all too often the case, for censorship.Â  And censorship, that by-product of fear - stemming as it does not from some positive agenda, but from the desire to escape our own terrors and superstitions by imposing them on others - must surely be resisted.Â  ~Jonathon Green, "Did You Say 'Offensive?'," as posted on wordwizard.com

At Christmas
A man is at his finest towards the finish of the year;
He is almost what he should be when the Christmas season's here;
Then he's thinking more of others than he's thought the months before,
And the laughter of his children is a joy worth toiling for.
He is less a selfish creature than at any other time;
When the Christmas spirit rules him he comes close to the sublime...
~Edgar Guest

Christmas is the season when you buy this year's gifts with next year's money.Â  ~Author Unknown

The Church does not superstitiously observe days, merely as days, but as memorials of important facts.Â  Christmas might be kept as well upon one day of the year as another; but there should be a stated day for commemorating the birth of our Saviour, because there is danger that what may be done on any day, will be neglected.Â  ~Samuel Johnson

As long as we know in our hearts what Christmas ought to be, Christmas is.Â  ~Eric Sevareid

Monroe

Violets are bluish
If it weren't for Christmas

The Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot have a nativity scene in Washington, D.C.Â  This wasn't for any religious reasons.Â  They couldn't find three wise men and a virgin.Â  ~Jay Leno

I hear that in many places something has happened to Christmas; that it is changing from a time of merriment and carefree gaiety to a holiday which is filled with tedium; that many people dread the day and the obligation to give Christmas presents is a nightmare to weary, bored souls; that the children of enlightened parents no longer believe in Santa Claus; that all in all, the effort to be happy and have pleasure makes many honest hearts grow dark with despair instead of beaming with good will and cheerfulness.Â  ~Julia Peterkin, A Plantation Christmas, 1934

The earth has grown old with its burden of care,
But at Christmas it always is young....

Merely of merchant's trafficking,
Of tinsel, bell and holly wreath

Nourishment for soul and mind.
Let us follow kinder ways
Through our teeming human maze,
And help the age of peace to come
From a Dreamer's martyrdom.

Once again we find ourselves enmeshed in the Holiday Season, that very special time of year when we join with our loved ones in sharing centuries-old traditions such as trying to find a parking space at the mall.Â  We traditionally do this in my family by driving around the parking lot until we see a shopper emerge from the mall, then we follow her, in very much the same spirit as the Three Wise Men, who 2,000 years ago followed a star, week after week, until it led them to a parking space.Â  ~Dave Barry

Wouldn't life be worth the living
Wouldn't dreams be coming true
If we kept the Christmas spirit
All the whole year through?

The universal joy of Christmas is certainly wonderful.Â  We ring the bells when princes are born, or toll a mournful dirge when great men pass away.Â  Nations have their red-letter days, their carnivals and festivals, but once in the year and only once, the whole world stands still to celebrate the advent of a life.Â  ~Author Unknown

We ring the bells and we raise the strain
We hang up garlands everywhere
And bid the tapers twinkle fair,

Back to the same old lives again.

To hear sleigh bells in the snow...

Its poignant meaning for the hearts of men.
Let us get back our childlike faith again.

Love all lovely, Love Divine;
Love was born at Christmas;

Christmas - that magic blanket that wraps itself about us, that something so intangible that it is like a fragrance.Â  It may weave a spell of nostalgia.Â  Christmas may be a day of feasting, or of prayer, but always it will be a day of remembrance - a day in which we think of everything we have ever loved.Â  ~Augusta E. Rundel

Santa is very jolly because he knows where all the bad girls live.Â  ~Dennis Miller

In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there....

Christmas in Bethlehem.Â  The ancient dream: a cold, clear night made brilliant by a glorious star, the smell of incense, shepherds and wise men falling to their knees in adoration of the sweet baby, the incarnation of perfect love.Â  ~Lucinda Franks

Oh! lovely voices of the sky
Which hymned the Saviour's birth,
Are ye not singing still on high,
Ye that sang, "Peace on earth"?
~Felicia Hemans

We hear the beating of wings over Bethlehem and a light that is not of the sun or of the stars shines in the midnight sky.Â  Let the beauty of the story take away all narrowness, all thought of formal creeds.Â  Let it be remembered as a story that has happened again and again, to men of many different races, that has been expressed through many religions, that has been called by many different names.Â  Time and space and language lay no limitations upon human brotherhood.Â  ~New York Times, 25 December 1937, quoted in Quotations for Special Occasions by Maud van Buren, 1938, published by The H.W. Wilson Company, New York

It would have been more logical if silent pictures had grown out of the talkies instead of the other way around.Â  ~Mary Pickford

It is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support.Â  If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau, On the Duty of Civil Disobedience

It maketh me to wake in green pastures:
It leadeth me beyond the sleeping masses.
It restoreth my buzz:
It leadeth me in the paths of consciousness for its name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of addiction,
I will fear no EqualÂ:
For thou art with me; thy cream and thy sugar they comfort me.
Thou preparest a carafe before me in the presence of The Starbucks:

Surely richness and taste shall follow me all the days of my life:
And I will dwell in the House of Mochas forever.

Only as deep as I look can I see,
Only as much as I dream can I be.
~Karen Ravn

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.Â  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.Â  It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.Â  We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?Â  Actually, who are you not to be?Â  You are a child of God.Â  Your playing small does not serve the world.Â  There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.Â  We are all meant to shine, as children do.Â  We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.Â  It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.Â  And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.Â  As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.Â  ~Marianne Williamson, A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of "A Course in Miracles," 1992 (commonly misattributed to Nelson Mandela, 1994 inauguration speech)

The good, say the mystics of spirit, is God, a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man's power to conceive - a definition that invalidates man's consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence.Â  The good, say the mystics of muscle, is Society - a thing which they define as an organism that possesses no physical form, a super-being embodied in no one in particular and everyone in general except yourself.... The purpose of man's life, say both, is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does not know, for reasons he is not to question.Â  ~Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged, 1957 (Thanks, Mary)

Traditions are group efforts to keep the unexpected from happening.Â  ~Mignon McLaughlin, The Neurotic's Notebook, 1960

My manner of thinking, so you say, cannot be approved.Â  Do you suppose I care?Â  A poor fool indeed is he who adopts a manner of thinking for others!Â  My manner of thinking stems straight from my considered reflections; it holds with my existence, with the way I am made.Â  It is not in my power to alter it; and were it, I'd not do so.Â  ~Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade

My uncle ordered popovers
from the restaurant's bill of fare.
And, when they were served,
he regarded them with a penetrating stare.
Then he spoke great words of wisdom
as he sat there on that chair:
"To eat these things," said my uncle,
"You must exercise great care.
You may swallow down what's solid,
but you must spit out the air!"
And as you partake of the world's bill of fare,
that's darned good advice to follow.
Do a lot of spitting out the hot air.
And be careful what you swallow.
~Theodore Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss), from a commencement address

What makes you think that human beings are sentient and aware?Â  There's no evidence for it.Â  Human beings never think for themselves, they find it too uncomfortable.Â  For the most part, members of our species simply repeat what they are told - and become upset if they are exposed to any different view.Â  The characteristic human trait is not awareness but conformity, and the characteristic result is religious warfare.Â  Other animals fight for territory or food; but, uniquely in the animal kingdom, human beings fight for their "beliefs."Â  The reason is that beliefs guide behavior, which has evolutionary importance among human beings.Â  But at a time when our behavior may well lead us to extinction, I see no reason to assume we have any awareness at all.Â  We are stubborn, self-destructive conformists.Â  Any other view of our species is a self-congratulatory delusion.Â  ~Michael Crichton, The Lost World

Until you've lost your reputation, you never realize what a burden it was.Â  ~Margaret Mitchell

The poverty of our century is unlike that of any other.Â  It is not, as poverty was before, the result of natural scarcity, but of a set of priorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich.Â  Consequently, the modern poor are not pitied... but written off as trash.Â  The twentieth-century consumer economy has produced the first culture for which a beggar is a reminder of nothing.Â  ~John Berger

And all the colors I am inside
Have not been invented yet.

A living planet is a much more complex metaphor for deity than just a bigger father with a bigger fist.Â  If an omniscient, all-powerful Dad ignores your prayers, it's taken personally.Â  Hear only silence long enough, and you start wondering about his power.Â  His fairness.Â  His very existence.Â  But if a world mother doesn't reply, Her excuse is simple.Â  She never claimed conceited omnipotence.Â  She has countless others clinging to her apron strings, including myriad species unable to speak for themselves.Â  To Her elder offspring She says - go raid the fridge.Â  Go play outside.Â  Go get a job.Â  Or, better yet, lend me a hand.Â  I have no time for idle whining.Â  ~David Brin


Till now man has been up against Nature; from now on he will be up against his own nature.Â  ~Dennis Gabor, Inventing the Future, 1963

Oh Beautiful for smoggy skies, insecticided grain,
For strip-mined mountain's majesty above the asphalt plain.
America, America, man sheds his waste on thee,

It is the hour to rend thy chains,
The blossom time of souls.Â  ~Katherine Lee Bates

Soul, soul, there is a sequel to thy tale!

Easter is not a time for groping through dusty, musty tomes or tombs to disprove spontaneous generation or even to prove life eternal.Â  It is a day to fan the ashes of dead hope, a day to banish doubts and seek the slopes where the sun is rising, to revel in the faith which transports us out of ourselves and the dead past into the vast and inviting unknown.Â  ~Author unknown, as quoted in the Lewiston Tribune

The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;

Unhurt amid the war of elements,
The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds.Â  ~Joseph Addison

The fasts are done; the Aves said;

So hushed the brooding air,

If one should earthward fare.

That maketh the leaf and the flower come out.Â  ~Bertran de Born

Easter tells us that life is to be interpreted not simply in terms of things but in terms of ideals.Â  ~Charles M. Crowe

The one real object of education is to have a man in the condition of continually asking questions.Â  ~Bishop Mandell Creighton


If you sincerely desire a truly well-rounded education, you must study the extremists, the obscure and "nutty."Â  You need the balance!Â  Your poor brain is already being impregnated with middle-of-the-road crap, twenty-four hours a day, no matter what.Â  Network TV, newspapers, radio, magazines at the supermarket... even if you never watch, read, listen, or leave your house, even if you are deaf and blind, the telepathic pressure alone of the uncountable normals surrounding you will insure that you are automatically well-grounded in consensus reality.Â  ~Ivan Stang, High Weirdness By Mail

Economic advance is not the same thing as human progress.Â  ~John Clapham, A Concise Economic History of Britain, 1957


And Man created the plastic bag and the tin and aluminum can and the cellophane wrapper and the paper plate, and this was good because Man could then take his automobile and buy all his food in one place and He could save that which was good to eat in the refrigerator and throw away that which had no further use.Â  And soon the earth was covered with plastic bags and aluminum cans and paper plates and disposable bottles and there was nowhere to sit down or walk, and Man shook his head and cried:Â  "Look at this Godawful mess."Â  ~Art Buchwald, 1970

The insufferable arrogance of human beings to think that Nature was made solely for their benefit, as if it was conceivable that the sun had been set afire merely to ripen men's apples and head their cabbages.Â  ~Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac, Ãtats et empires de la lune, 1656


Such is the audacity of man, that he hath learned to counterfeit Nature, yea, and is so bold as to challenge her in her work.Â  ~Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, translated by Philemon Holland


Oh Beautiful for smoggy skies, insecticided grain,
For strip-mined mountain's majesty above the asphalt plain.
America, America, man sheds his waste on thee,
And hides the pines with billboard signs, from sea to oily sea.
~George Carlin


A living planet is a much more complex metaphor for deity than just a bigger father with a bigger fist.Â  If an omniscient, all-powerful Dad ignores your prayers, it's taken personally.Â  Hear only silence long enough, and you start wondering about his power.Â  His fairness.Â  His very existence.Â  But if a world mother doesn't reply, Her excuse is simple.Â  She never claimed conceited omnipotence.Â  She has countless others clinging to her apron strings, including myriad species unable to speak for themselves.Â  To Her elder offspring She says - go raid the fridge.Â  Go play outside.Â  Go get a job.Â  Or, better yet, lend me a hand.Â  I have no time for idle whining.Â  ~David Brin


Why do people give each other flowers?Â  To celebrate various important occasions, they're killing living creatures?Â  Why restrict it to plants?Â  "Sweetheart, let's make up.Â  Have this deceased squirrel."Â  ~The Washington Post


Till now man has been up against Nature; from now on he will be up against his own nature.Â  ~Dennis Gabor, Inventing the Future, 1964

And cast your spittle in God's face.

When we heal the earth, we heal ourselves.Â  ~David Orr


We cannot command Nature except by obeying her.Â  ~Francis Bacon


There is nothing in which the birds differ more from man than the way in which they can build and yet leave a landscape as it was before.Â  ~Robert Lynd, The Blue Lion and Other Essays






Will urban sprawl spread so far that most people lose all touch with nature?Â  Will the day come when the only bird a typical American child ever sees is a canary in a pet shop window?Â  When the only wild animal he knows is a rat - glimpsed on a night drive through some city slum?Â  When the only tree he touches is the cleverly fabricated plastic evergreen that shades his gifts on Christmas morning?Â  ~Frank N. Ikard, North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference, Houston, March 1968


How long can men thrive between walls of brick, walking on asphalt pavements, breathing the fumes of coal and of oil, growing, working, dying, with hardly a thought of wind, and sky, and fields of grain, seeing only machine-made beauty, the mineral-like quality of life?Â  ~Charles A. Lindbergh, Reader's Digest, November 1939


It is imperative to maintain portions of the wilderness untouched so that a tree will rot where it falls, a waterfall will pour its curve without generating electricity, a trumpeter swan may float on uncontaminated water - and moderns may at least see what their ancestors knew in their nerves and blood.Â  ~Bernand De Voto, Fortune, June 1947


Take care of the earth and she will take care of you.Â  ~Author Unknown


We could have saved the Earth but we were too damned cheap.Â  ~Kurt Vonnegut,Â Jr.


Something will have gone out of us as a people if we ever let the remaining wilderness be destroyed; if we permit the last virgin forests to be turned into comic books and plastic cigarette cases; if we drive the few remaining members of the wild species into zoos or to extinction; if we pollute the last clear air and dirty the last clean streams and push our paved roads through the last of the silence, so that never again will Americans be free in their own country from the noise, the exhausts, the stinks of human and automotive waste.Â  ~Wallace Stegner, letter to David E. Pesonen of the Wildland Research Center, 3 December 1960 (Thanks, Bekah)


Waste not the smallest thing created, for grains of sand make mountains, and atomies infinity.Â  ~E.Â Knight


Opie, you haven't finished your milk.Â  We can't put it back in the cow, you know.Â  ~Aunt Bee Taylor, The Andy Griffith Show

It is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save the environment.Â  ~Ansel Adams

The control man has secured over nature has far outrun his control over himself.Â  ~Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, 1953

Every day is Earth Day.Â  ~Author Unknown

Nature's laws affirm instead of prohibit.Â  If you violate her laws you are your own prosecuting attorney, judge, jury, and hangman.Â  ~Luther Burbank


Dig a trench through a landfill and you will see layers of phone books like geographical strata or layers of cake....

Environmentalists have long been fond of saying that the sun is the only safe nuclear reactor, situated as it is some ninety-three million miles away.Â  ~Stephanie Mills, ed., In Praise of Nature, 1990


How can the spirit of the earth like the white man?... Everywhere the white man has touched it, it is sore.Â  ~Anonymous Wintu Woman

The universe is not required to be in perfect harmony with human ambition.Â  ~Carl Sagan

It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life.Â  ~Rachel Carson

Man is a complex being:Â  he makes deserts bloom - and lakes die.Â  ~Gil Stern

Humanity is on the march, earth itself is left behind.Â  ~David Ehrenfeld, The Arrogance of Humanism, 1978

The rose has thorns only for those who would gather it.Â  ~Chinese Proverb


Soon silence will have passed into legend.Â  Man has turned his back on silence.Â  Day after day he invents machines and devices that increase noise and distract humanity from the essence of life, contemplation, meditation... tooting, howling, screeching, booming, crashing, whistling, grinding, and trilling bolster his ego.Â  His anxiety subsides.Â  His inhuman void spreads monstrously like a gray vegetation.Â  ~JeanÂ Arp


We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.Â  ~Albert Einstein


Man has been endowed with reason, with the power to create, so that he can add to what he's been given.Â  But up to now he hasn't been a creator, only a destroyer.Â  Forests keep disappearing, rivers dry up, wild life's become extinct, the climate's ruined and the land grows poorer and uglier every day.Â  ~Anton Chekhov, Uncle Vanya, 1897


A human being is part of the whole, called by us "Universe," a part limited in time and space.Â  He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.Â  This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.Â  Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole [of] nature in its beauty.Â  ~Albert Einstein, 1950


A margin of life is developed by Nature for all living things - including man.Â  All life forms obey Nature's demands - except man, who has found ways of ignoring them.Â  ~Eugene M. Poirot, Our Margin of Life, 1978


When you use a manual push mower, you're "cutting" down on pollution and the only thing in danger of running out of gas is you!Â  ~Grey Livingston


After a visit to the beach, it's hard to believe that we live in a material world.Â  ~Pam Shaw


As we watch the sun go down, evening after evening, through the smog across the poisoned waters of our native earth, we must ask ourselves seriously whether we really wish some future universal historian on another planet to say about us:Â  "With all their genius and with all their skill, they ran out of foresight and air and food and water and ideas," or, "They went on playing politics until their world collapsed around them."Â  ~U Thant, speech, 1970


The command "Be fruitful and multiply" was promulgated, according to our authorities, when the population of the world consisted of two people.Â  ~William Ralph Inge, More Lay Thoughts of a Dean, 1931


Christianity, with its roots in Judaism, was a major factor in the development of the Western worldview.... A basic Christian belief was that God gave humans dominion over creation, with the freedom to use the environment as they saw fit.Â  Another important Judeo-Christian belief predicted that God would bring a cataclysmic end to the Earth sometime in the future.Â  One interpretation of this belief is that the Earth is only a temporary way station on the soul's journey to the afterlife.Â  Because these beliefs tended to devalue the natural world, they fostered attitudes and behaviors that had a negative effect on the environment.Â  ~Donald G. Kaufman and Cecilia M. Franz, Biosphere 2000:Â  Protecting Our Global Environment, 1996


For the first time in the history of the world, every human being is now subjected to contact with dangerous chemicals, from the moment of conception until death.Â  ~Rachel Carson, Silent Spring, 1962


I realized that Eastern thought had somewhat more compassion for all living things.Â  Man was a form of life that in another reincarnation might possibly be a horsefly or a bird of paradise or a deer.Â  So a man of such a faith, looking at animals, might be looking at old friends or ancestors.Â  In the East the wilderness has no evil connotation; it is thought of as an expression of the unity and harmony of the universe.Â  ~William O. Douglas, Go East, Young Man, 1974






If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago.Â  If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.Â  ~Edward O. Wilson


Malthus has been buried many times, and Malthusian scarcity with him.Â  But as Garrett Hardin remarked, anyone who has to be reburied so often cannot be entirely dead.Â  ~Herman E. Daly, Steady-State Economics, 1977


Somebody told me it was frightening how much topsoil we are losing each year, but when I told that story around the campfire, nobody got scared.Â  ~Jack Handey


The human race will be the cancer of the planet.Â  ~Julian Huxley, attributed


Man will survive as a species for one reason:Â  He can adapt to the destructive effects of our power-intoxicated technology and of our ungoverned population growth, to the dirt, pollution and noise of a New York or Tokyo.Â  And that is the tragedy.Â  It is not man the ecological crisis threatens to destroy but the quality of human life.Â  ~RenÃ© Dubos, quoted in Life, 28 July 1970


One of the first laws against air pollution came in 1300 when King Edward I decreed the death penalty for burning of coal.Â  At least one execution for that offense is recorded.Â  But economics triumphed over health considerations, and air pollution became an appalling problem in England.Â  ~Glenn T. Seaborg, Atomic Energy Commission chairman, speech, Argonne National Laboratory, 1969


Our children may save us if they are taught to care properly for the planet; but if not, it may be back to the Ice Age or the caves from where we first emerged.Â  Then we'll have to view the universe above from a cold, dark place.Â  No more jet skis, nuclear weapons, plastic crap, broken pay phones, drugs, cars, waffle irons, or television.Â  Come to think of it, that might not be a bad idea.Â  ~Jimmy Buffet, Mother Earth News, March-April 1990


Racial injustice, war, urban blight, and environmental rape have a common denominator in our exploitative economic system.Â  ~Channing E. Phillips, speech, Washington, D.C., 22 April 1970


The days a man spends fishing or spends hunting should not be deducted from the time that he's on earth.Â  In other words, if I fish today, that should be added to the amount of time I get to live.Â  That's the way I look at recreation.Â  That's why I'll be a big conservation, environmental President, because I plan to fish and hunt as much as I possibly can.Â  ~George Bush, quoted in Los Angeles Times, 30 December 1988


The desire to build a risk-free society has always been a sign of decadence.Â  It has meant that the nation has given up, that it no longer believes in its destiny, that it has ceased to aspire to greatness, and has retired from history to pet itself.Â  ~Henry Fairlie, quoted in Conservation Foundation Letter, November 1981


The exquisite sight, sound, and smell of wilderness is many times more powerful if it is earned through physical achievement, if it comes at the end of a long and fatiguing trip for which vigorous good health is necessary.Â  Practically speaking, this means that no one should be able to enter a wilderness by mechanical means.Â  ~Garrett Hardin, The Ecologist, February 1974


The struggle to save the global environment is in one way much more difficult than the struggle to vanquish Hitler, for this time the war is with ourselves.Â  We are the enemy, just as we have only ourselves as allies.Â  ~Al Gore


Give a man a fish, and he can eat for a day.Â  But teach a man how to fish, and he'll be dead of mercury poisoning inside of three years.Â  ~Charles Haas


You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of your grandfathers.Â  So that they will respect the land, tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives of our kin.Â  Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the earth is our mother.Â  Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth.Â  If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves.Â  ~Native American Wisdom

This is a beautiful planet and not at all fragile.Â  Earth can withstand significant volcanic eruptions, tectonic cataclysms, and ice ages.Â  But this canny, intelligent, prolific, and extremely self-centered human creature had proven himself capable of more destruction of life than Mother Nature herself....

Today's world is one in which the age-old risks of humankind - the drought, floods, communicable diseases - are less of a problem than ever before.Â  They have been replaced by risks of humanity's own making - the unintended side-effects of beneficial technologies and the intended effects of the technologies of war.Â  Society must hope that the world's ability to assess and manage risks will keep pace with its ability to create them.Â  ~J. Clarence Davies, quoted in Conservation Foundation, State of the Environment: An Assessment at Mid-Decade, 1984

We have always had reluctance to see a tract of land which is empty of men as anything but a void.Â  The "waste howling wilderness" of Deuteronomy is typical.Â  The Oxford Dictionary defines wilderness as wild or uncultivated land which is occupied "only" by wild animals.Â  Places not used by us are "wastes."Â  Areas not occupied by us are "desolate."Â  Could the desolation be in the soul of man?Â  ~John A. Livingston, in Borden Spears, ed., Wilderness Canada, 1970


We must not be forced to explore the universe in search of a new home because we have made the Earth inhospitable, even uninhabitable.Â  For if we do not solve the environmental and related social problems that beset us on Earth - pollution, toxic contamination, resource depletion, prejudice, poverty, hunger - those problems will surely accompany us to other worlds.Â  ~Donald G. Kaufman and Cecilia M. Franz, Biosphere 2000:Â  Protecting Our Global Environment, 1996

Western society has accepted as unquestionable a technological imperative that is quite as arbitrary as the most primitive taboo:Â  not merely the duty to foster invention and constantly to create technological novelties, but equally the duty to surrender to these novelties unconditionally, just because they are offered, without respect to their human consequences.Â  ~Lewis Mumford

When we Indians kill meat, we eat it all up.... When we build houses, we make little holes.Â  When we burn grass for grasshoppers, we don't ruin things.Â  We shake down acorns and pinenuts.Â  We don't chop down the trees.Â  ~Wintu Indian, quoted in Julian Burger, The Gaia Atlas of First Peoples, 1990


We have to shift our emphasis from economic efficiency and materialism towards a sustainable quality of life and to healing of our society, of our people and our ecological systems.Â  ~Janet Holmes à Court

You go into a community and they will vote 80 percent to 20 percent in favor of a tougher Clean Air Act, but if you ask them to devote 20 minutes a year to having their car emissions inspected, they will vote 80 to 20 against it.Â  We are a long way in this country from taking individual responsibility for the environmental problem.Â  ~William D. Ruckelshaus, former EPA administrator, New York Times, 30 November 1988


Zoos are becoming facsimiles - or perhaps caricatures - of how animals once were in their natural habitat.Â  If the right policies toward nature were pursued, we would need no zoos at all.Â  ~Michael Fox, Sierra, November-December 1990

Exaggeration is in the course of things.Â  Nature sends no creature, no man into the world, without adding a small excess of his proper quality.Â  Given the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so, to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path, a shove to put it on its way; in every instance, a slight generosity, a drop too much.Â  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson

The face is more honest than the mouth will ever be.Â  ~Daphne Orebaugh

The lack of emotional security of our American young people is due, I believe, to their isolation from the larger family unit.Â  No two people - no mere father and mother - as I have often said, are enough to provide emotional security for a child.Â  He needs to feel himself one in a world of kinfolk, persons of variety in age and temperament, and yet allied to himself by an indissoluble bond which he cannot break if he could, for nature has welded him into it before he was born.Â  ~Pearl S. Buck

There is more difference within the sexes than between them.Â  ~Ivy Compton-Burnett, Mother and Son


Because women's work is never done and is underpaid or unpaid or boring or repetitious and we're the first to get fired and what we look like is more important than what we do and if we get raped it's our fault and if we get beaten we must have provoked it and if we raise our voices we're nagging bitches and if we enjoy sex we're nymphos and if we don't we're frigid and if we love women it's because we can't get a "real" man and if we ask our doctor too many questions we're neurotic and/or pushy and if we expect childcare we're selfish and if we stand up for our rights we're aggressive and "unfeminine" and if we don't we're typical weak females and if we want to get married we're out to trap a man and if we don't we're unnatural and because we still can't get an adequate safe contraceptive but men can walk on the moon and if we can't cope or don't want a pregnancy we're made to feel guilty about abortion and...for lots of other reasons we are part of the women's liberation movement.Â  ~Author unknown, quoted in The Torch, 14 September 1987

Many beautiful women have been made happy by their own beauty, but no intelligent woman has ever been made happy by her own intelligence.Â  ~Mignon McLaughlin, The Second Neurotic's Notebook, 1966


During the feminist revolution, the battle lines were again simple.Â  It was easy to tell the enemy, he was the one with the penis.Â  This is no longer strictly true.Â  Some men are okay now.Â  We're allowed to like them again.Â  We still have to keep them in line, of course, but we no longer have to shoot them on sight.Â  ~Cynthia Heimel, Sex Tips for Girls, 1983

You don't have to signal a social conscience by looking like a frump.Â  Lace knickers won't hasten the holocaust, you can ban the bomb in a feather boa just as well as without, and a mild interest in the length of hemlines doesn't necessarily disqualify you from reading Das Kapital and agreeing with every word.Â  ~Elizabeth Bibesco

What is a firefighter?
He's the guy next door....
He's a guy like you and me with warts and worries and unfulfilled dreams.
Yet he stands taller than most of us.
He's a fireman....
A fireman is at once the most fortunate and the least fortunate of men.
He's a man who saves lives because he has seen too much death.
He's a gentle man because he has seen the awesome power of violence out of control.
He's responsive to a child's laughter because his arms have held too many small bodies that will never laugh again....
He doesn't preach the brotherhood of man.
He lives it.

So as you look at the firefighter with his rake, hose or axe,
His beet red face or ice covered mustache,
You should know why he goes through that smoky front door,
And is forced to crawl like a baby down on the floor.

All that is precious to you and to me. 
So take a good look at this modern warrior who serves his call proud and true,
And know that he would die just to save me and you.
~Robert J. Athans

Whatever the Americans are proud of - whatever they consider to be particularly good, useful, brilliant, or characteristic of themselves or their climate, they designate, half in jest, though scarcely half in earnest, as an "institution."Â  Thus the memory of George Washington... is an institution; the Falls of Niagara are an institution; the Plymouth Rock, on which the Pilgrim Fathers first set foot, is an institution...; "Sweet potatoes" are an institution, and Pumpkin (or Punkin) pie is an institution; ...squash is an institution; Bunker Hill is an institution; and the firemen of New York are a great institution.Â  ~Charles Mackay, Life and Liberty in America, 1850

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze

They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

Being perfect artists and ingenuous poets, the Chinese have piously preserved the love and holy cult of flowers; one of the very rare and most ancient traditions which has survived their decadence.Â  And since flowers had to be distinguished from each other, they have attributed graceful analogies to them, dreamy images, pure and passionate names which perpetuate and harmonize in our minds the sensations of gentle charm and violent intoxication with which they inspire us.Â  So it is that certain peonies, their favorite flower, are saluted by the Chinese, according to their form or color, by these delicious names, each an entire poem and an entire novel:Â  The Young Girl Who Offers Her Breasts, or: The Water That Sleeps Beneath the Moon, or: The Sunlight in the Forest, or: The First Desire of the Reclining Virgin, or: My Gown Is No Longer All White Because in Tearing It the Son of Heaven Left a Little Rosy Stain; or, even better, this one: I Possessed My Lover in the Garden.Â  ~Octave Mirbeau, Torture Garden, "The Garden," ChapterÂ 5

When I was a Boy Scout, we played a game when new Scouts joined the troop.Â  We lined up chairs in a pattern, creating an obstacle course through which the new Scouts, blindfolded, were supposed to maneuver.Â  The Scoutmaster gave them a few moments to study the pattern before our adventure began.Â  But as soon as the victims were blindfolded, the rest of us quietly removed the chairs.Â  I think life is like this game.Â  Perhaps we spend our lives avoiding obstacles we have created for ourselves and in reality exist only in our minds.Â  We're afraid to apply for that job, take violin lessons, learn a foreign language, call an old friend, write our Congressman - whatever it is that we would really like to do but don't because of personal obstacles.Â  Don't avoid any chairs until you run smack into one.Â  And if you do, at least you'll have a place to sit down.Â  ~Pierce Vincent Eckhart

Most people would succeed in small things if they were not troubled with great ambitions.Â  ~Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Drift-Wood

None of our men are "experts."Â  We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job.Â  A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient he is.Â  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible.Â  The moment one gets into the "expert" state of mind a great number of things become impossible.Â  ~Henry Ford,Â Sr.

There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.Â  ~Peter Drucker

One may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low.Â  ~Thomas Fuller

When people say to me:Â  "How do you do so many things?"Â  I often answer them, without meaning to be cruel:Â  "How do you do so little?"Â  It seems to me that people have vast potential.Â  Most people can do extraordinary things if they have the confidence or take the risks.Â  Yet most people don't.Â  They sit in front of the telly and treat life as if it goes on forever.Â  ~Philip Adams

Establishing goals is all right if you don't let them deprive you of interesting detours.Â  ~Doug Larson

Experience has repeatedly confirmed that well-known maxim of Bacon's that "a little philosophy inclineth a man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."Â  At the same time, when Bacon penned that sage epigram... he forgot to add that the God to whom depth in philosophy brings back men's minds is far from being the same from whom a little philosophy estranges them.Â  ~George Santayana

You found God?Â  If nobody claims him in thirty days, he's yours!Â  ~Author Unknown

When I saw others straining toward God, I did not understand it, for though I may have had him less than they did, there was no one blocking the way between him and me, and I could reach his heart easily.Â  It is up to him, after all, to have us, our part consists of almost solely in letting him grasp us.Â  ~Rainer Maria Rilke, Rilke and Benvenuta: An Intimate Correspondence

~Lord Byron

A goodbye isn't painful unless you're never going to say hello again.Â  ~Author Unknown

A chord, stronger or weaker, is snapped asunder in every parting, and time's busy fingers are not practiced in re-splicing broken ties.Â  Meet again you may; will it be in the same way?Â  With the same sympathies?Â  With the same sentiments?Â  Will the souls, hurrying on in diverse paths, unite once more, as if the interval had been a dream?Â  Rarely, rarely!Â  ~Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton

The plague of government is senile delinquency.Â  ~Mignon McLaughlin, The Neurotic's Notebook, 1960

Our government has become too responsive to trivial or ephemeral concerns, often at the expense of more important concerns or an erosion of our liberty, and it has made policy priorities more dependent on where TV journalists happen to point their cameras.... As a nation we have lost our sense of tragedy, a recognition that bad things happen to good people.Â  A nation that expects the government to prevent churches from burning, to control the price of bread or gasoline, to secure every job, and to find some villain for every dramatic accident, risks an even larger loss of life and liberty.Â  ~William A.

A lot of guys have had a lot of fun joking about Henry Ford because he admitted one time that he didn't know history.Â  He don't know it, but history will know him.Â  He has made more history than his critics ever read.Â  ~Will Rogers

Almost the whole of history is but a sequence of horrors.Â  ~SÃ©bastien Roch Nicolas Chamfort, Maxims and Considerations

You don't change the course of history by turning the faces of portraits to the wall.Â  ~Jawaharlal Nehru


The best portraits are perhaps those in which there is a slight mixture of caricature; and we are not certain that the best histories are not those in which a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative is judiciously employed.Â  Something is lost in accuracy; but much is gained in effect.Â  The fainter lines are neglected; but the great characteristic features are imprinted on the mind forever.Â  ~Thomas Babington Macaulay, Machiavelli


History is the story of events, with praise or blame.Â  ~Cotton Mather

In a certain sense all men are historians.Â  ~Thomas Carlyle, Essays: On History


It is pleasant to be transferred from an office where one is afraid of a sergeant-major into an office where one can intimidate generals, and perhaps this is why history is so attractive to the more timid among us.Â  We can recover self-confidence by snubbing the dead.Â  ~E.M.

History... is an aggregation of truths, half-truths, semi-truths, fables, myths, rumors, prejudices, personal narratives, gossip, and official prevarications.Â  It is a canvas upon which thousands of artists throughout the ages have splashed their conceptions and interpretations of a day and an era.Â  Some motifs are grotesque and some are magnificent.Â  ~Philip D.

The present is the past rolled up for action, and the past is the present unrolled for understanding.Â  ~Will and Ariel Durant, The Reformation


[T]he historian lays humanity on the couch.Â  ~Lynn White, Jr.


History is the most dangerous product which the chemistry of the mind has concocted.Â  Its properties are well known.Â  It produces dreams and drunkenness.Â  It fills people with false memories, exaggerates their reactions, exacerbates old grievances, torments them in their repose, and encourages either a delirium of grandeur or a delusion of persecution.Â  It makes whole nations bitter, arrogant, insufferable and vainglorious.Â  ~Paul ValÃ©ry, Regards sur le Monde Actuel


The study of history is the playground of patriotism.Â  ~George M. Wrong

Every major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive.Â  Has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism?Â  ~Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead

[T]hat is the triumph of history - truth absolute is not at hand; the original with which to match the copy does not exist.Â  ~Jacques Barzun, Clio and the Doctors


Without philosophy, history seems to me to be deaf and dumb.Â  ~Ferdinand Baur, Symbolik und Mythologic


The past remains integral to us all, individually and collectively.Â  We must concede the ancients their place, as I have argued.Â  But their place is not simply back there in a separate and foreign country; it is assimilated in ourselves, and resurrected into an ever-changing present.Â  ~David Lowenthal, The Past Is a Foreign Country


For the rubble of history, which is undigested and therefore goes on blindly, does not lie so thickly on the ground as in our own consciousness.Â  ~Herbert LÃ¼thy


Unlike poetry and music, the art of history is cumulative.Â  ~John Clive, Not By Fact Alone


In studying history we are finding out about ourselves, and in the last resort the natural sciences and even mathematics have the same final end.Â  ~Vivian Hunter Galbraith, An Introduction to the Study of History


History is the record of what one age finds worthy of note in another.Â  ~Jacob Burckhardt


The entire history of mankind is, in any case, nothing but a prolonged fight to the death for the conquest of universal prestige and absolute power.Â  ~Albert Camus, The Rebel


History is concerned primarily with human phenomena, not with natural; and history is doubly human because, as an idea, it is man's creation, challenging him to transcend the limits of information about himself and to discover what he is by finding meaning in what he has done.Â  In short, it is man's commentary on man.Â  ~John Barker, The Superhistorians


For me, in fact, the mark of the historic is the nonchalance with which it picks up an individual and deposits him in a trend, like a house playfully moved by a tornado.Â  ~Mary McCarthy, On the Contrary


The unrecorded past is none other than our old friend, the tree in the primeval forest which fell without being heard.Â  ~Barbara Tuchman

The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing Religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her native purity.Â  A more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian.Â  He must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption which she contracted in a long residence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate race of beings.Â  ~Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire


History attempts to provide society with an artificial collective memory.Â  ~Mark M. Krug, History and the Social Sciences

It is known that there is an infinite number of worlds, but that not every one is inhabited.Â  Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds.Â  Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so if every planet in the Universe has a population of zero then the entire population of the Universe must also be zero, and any people you may actually meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.Â  ~Douglas Adams, The Original Hitchhiker Radio Script

I have figured for you the distance between the horns of a dilemma, night and day, and A and Z.Â  I have computed how far is Up, how long it takes to get Away, and what becomes of Gone.Â  I have discovered the length of the sea serpent, the price of priceless, and the square of the hippopotamus.Â  I know where you are when you are at Sixes and Sevens, how much Is you have to have to make an Are, and how many birds you can catch with the salt in the ocean - 187,796,132, if it would interest you.Â  ~James Thurber, Many Moons

Like waves that follow o'er the sea,
Came thickly thundering on,...

Among all the sights of the docks, the noble truck-horses are not the least striking to a stranger.Â  They are large and powerful brutes, with such sleek and glossy coats, that they look as if brushed and put on by a valet every morning.Â  They march with a slow and stately step, lifting their ponderous hoofs like royal Siam elephants.Â  Thou shalt not lay stripes upon these Roman citizens; for their docility is such, they are guided without rein or lash; they go or come, halt or march on, at a whisper.Â  So grave, dignified, gentlemanly, and courteous did these fine truck-horses look - so full of calm intelligence and sagacity, that often I endeavored to get into conversation with them, as they stood in contemplative attitudes while their loads were preparing.Â  But all I could get from them was the mere recognition of a friendly neigh; though I would stake much upon it that, could I have spoken in their language, I would have derived from them a good deal of valuable information touching the docks, where they passed the whole of their dignified lives.Â  ~Herman Melville, Redburn. His First Voyage, 1849

A horse which stops dead just before a jump and thus propels its rider into a graceful arc provides a splendid excuse for general merriment.Â  ~Duke of Endinburgh


Again the early-morning sun was generous with its warmth.Â  All the sounds dear to a horseman were around me - the snort of the horses as they cleared their throats, the gentle swish of their tails, the tinkle of irons as we flung the saddles over their backs - little sounds of no importance, but they stay in the unconscious library of memory.Â  ~Wynford Vaughan-Thomas


You know horses are smarter than people.Â  You never heard of a horse going broke betting on people.Â  ~Will Rogers

A horse can lend its rider the speed and strength he or she lacks, but the rider who is wise remembers it is no more than a loan.Â  ~Pam Brown


Where in this wide world can man find nobility without pride,
Friendship without envy,
Or beauty without vanity?
Here, where grace is served with muscle
And strength by gentleness confined
He serves without servility; he has fought without enmity.
There is nothing so powerful, nothing less violent.
There is nothing so quick, nothing more patient.

People have always cared me a bit, you see - they're so complicated.Â  I suppose that's why I prefer horses.Â  ~From the movie Separate Tables, 1958


There are unknown worlds of knowledge in brutes; and whenever you mark a horse, or a dog, with a peculiarly mild, calm, deep-seated eye, be sure he is an Aristotle or a Kant, tranquilly speculating upon the mysteries in man.Â  No philosophers so thoroughly comprehend us as dogs and horses.Â  They see through us at a glance.Â  And after all, what is a horse but a species of four-footed dumb man, in a leathern overall, who happens to live upon oats, and toils for his masters, half-requited or abused, like the biped hewers of wood and drawers of water?Â  But there is a touch of divinity even in brutes, and a special halo about a horse, that should forever exempt him from indignities.Â  As for those majestic, magisterial truck-horses of the docks, I would as soon think of striking a judge on the bench, as to lay violent hand upon their holy hides.Â  ~Herman Melville, Redburn. His First Voyage, 1849


The horse is God's gift to mankind.Â  ~Arabian Proverb

I prefer a bike to a horse.Â  The brakes are more easily checked.Â  ~Lambert Jeffries


What delight
To back the flying steed, that challenges
The wind for speed! - seems native more of air
Than earth! - whose burden only lends him fire! -
Whose soul, in his task, turns labour into sport;
Who makes your pastime his!Â  I sit him now!
He takes away my breath!Â  He makes me reel!
I touch not earth - I see not - hear not.Â  All
Is ecstasy of motion!
~James Sheridan Knowles, The Love-Chase

He's of the colour of the nutmeg.Â  And of the heat of the ginger.... he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him; he is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.Â  ~William Shakespeare, HenryÂ V

Is the music earth steals from the iron-shod feet;
No whisper of lover, no trilling of bird,
Can stir me as much as hooves of horses
Have stirred.

The daughter who won't lift a finger in the house is the same child who cycles madly off in the pouring rain to spend all morning mucking out a stable.Â  ~Samantha Armstrong


He flung himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.Â  ~Stephen Leacock


Why did this animal that had prospered so in the Colorado desert leave his amiable homeland for Siberia?Â  There is no answer.Â  We know that when the horse negotiated the land bridge... he found on the other end an opportunity for varied development that is one of the bright aspects of animal history.Â  He wandered into France and became the mighty Percheron, and into Arabia, where he developed into a lovely poem of a horse, and into Africa where he became the brilliant zebra, and into Scotland, where he bred selectively to form the massive Clydesdale.Â  He would also journey into Spain, where his very name would become the designation for gentleman, a caballero, a man of the horse.Â  There he would flourish mightily and serve the armies that would conquer much of the known world.Â   ~James Michener

Krishnamurti

To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature.Â  Most persons do not see the sun.Â  At least they have a very superficial seeing.Â  The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and heart of the child.Â  The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood.Â  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson

Maybe we should develop a Crayola bomb as our next secret weapon.Â  A happiness weapon.Â  A beauty bomb.Â  And every time a crisis developed, we would launch one.Â  It would explode high in the air - explode softly - and send thousands, millions, of little parachutes into the air.Â  Floating down to earth - boxes of Crayolas.Â  And we wouldn't go cheap, either - not little boxes of eight.Â  Boxes of sixty-four, with the sharpener built right in.Â  With silver and gold and copper, magenta and peach and lime, amber and umber and all the rest.Â  And people would smile and get a little funny look on their faces and cover the world with imagination.Â  ~Robert Fulghum

I am often accused of being childish.Â  I prefer to interpret that as child-like.Â  I still get wildly enthusiastic about little things.Â  I tend to exaggerate and fantasize and embellish.Â  I still listen to instinctual urges.Â  I play with leaves.Â  I skip down the street and run against the wind.Â  I never water my garden without soaking myself.Â  It has been after such times of joy that I have achieved my greatest creativity and produced my best work. ~Leo F. Buscaglia, Bus 9 to Paradise

As one reads history, not in the expurgated editions written for schoolboys and passmen, but in the original authorities of each time, one is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime.Â  ~Oscar Wilde, The Soul of Man Under Socialism

It is hard to say whether doctors of law or divinity have made the greater advances in the lucrative business of mystery.Â  ~Edmund Burke

The most absurd apology for authority and law is that they serve to diminish crime.Â  Aside from the fact that the State is itself the greatest criminal, breaking every written and natural law, stealing in the form of taxes, killing in the form of war and capital punishment, it has come to an absolute standstill in coping with crime.Â  It has failed utterly to destroy or even minimize the horrible scourge of its own creation.Â  ~Emma Goldman, Anarchism

The law condemns and punishes only actions within certain definite and narrow limits; it thereby justifies, in a way, all similar actions that lie outside those limits.Â  ~Leo Tolstoy, What I Believe

Order derived through submission and maintained by terror is not much of a safe guaranty; yet that is the only "order" that governments have ever maintained.Â  True social harmony grows naturally out of solidarity of interests.Â  In a society where those who always work never have anything, while those who never work enjoy everything, solidarity of interests is non-existent; hence social harmony is but a myth.... Thus the entire arsenal of governments - laws, police, soldiers, the courts, legislatures, prisons - is strenuously engaged in "harmonizing" the most antagonistic elements in society.Â  ~Emma Goldman, Anarchism

Hug a police officer.Â  It's the law!Â  ~Author Unknown

Judges are but men, and are swayed like other men by vehement prejudices.Â  This is corruption in reality, give it whatever other name you please.Â  ~David Dudley Field

Crimes were committed to punish crimes, and crimes were committed to prevent crimes.Â  The world has been filled with prisons and dungeons, with chains and whips, with crosses and gibbets, with thumbscrews and racks, with hangmen and heads-men - and yet these frightful means and instrumentalities have committed far more crimes than they have prevented.... Ignorance, filth, and poverty are the missionaries of crime.Â  As long as dishonorable success outranks honest effort - as long as society bows and cringes before the great thieves, there will be little ones enough to fill the jails.Â  ~Robert Ingersoll, Crimes Against Criminals

Every crime is born of necessity.Â  If you want less crime, you must change the conditions.Â  Poverty makes crime.Â  Want, rags, crusts, misfortune - all these awake the wild beast in man, and finally he takes, and takes contrary to law, and becomes a criminal.Â  And what do you do with him?Â  You punish him.Â  Why not punish a man for having consumption?Â  The time will come when you will see that that is just as logical.Â  What do you do with the criminal?Â  You send him to the penitentiary.Â  Is he made better?Â  Worse.Â  The first thing you do is to try to trample out his manhood, by putting an indignity upon him.Â  You mark him.Â  You put him in stripes.Â  At night you put him in darkness.Â  His feeling for revenge grows.Â  You make a wild beast of him, and he comes out of that place branded in body and soul, and then you won't let him reform if he wants to.Â  ~Robert Ingersoll, A Lay Sermon

We seem as a nation to be suffering from a mania for play.Â  The huge development of pleasure-chasing automobiles merely symbolizes our universal restless eagerness to be running after something, anything, that we can classify as diversion.Â  Under pressure from tormenting constituents our legislatures are piling up holidays.Â  And the cry of labor everywhere is "Cut down hours; cut down hours," until it seems as if brief, tired minutes were all that would be left for work.Â  The obvious deduction is that work is always something to be got rid of, as if it were a curse.Â  Yet life is work.Â  ~Author unknown, editorial from Labor Digest, June 1922, quoted in Quotations for Special Occasions by Maud van Buren

The quantity of consonants in the English language is constant.Â  If omitted in one place, they turn up in another.Â  When a Bostonian "pahks" his "cah," the lost r's migrate southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl wells."Â  ~Author Unknown

English is a funny language; that explains why we park our car on the driveway and drive our car on the parkway.Â  ~Author Unknown

W (double U) has, of all the letters in our alphabet, the only cumbrous name, the names of the others being monosyllabic.Â  This advantage of the Roman alphabet over the Grecian is the more valued after audibly spelling out some simple Greek word, like "epixoriambikos."Â  Still, it is now thought by the learned that other agencies than the difference of the two alphabets may have been concerned in the decline of "the glory that was Greece" and the rise of "the grandeur that was Rome."Â  There can be no doubt, however, that by simplifying the name of W (calling it "wow," for example) our civilization could be, if not promoted, at least better endured.Â  ~Ambrose Bierce

The existing phrasebooks are inadequate.Â  They are well enough as far as they go, but when you fall down and skin your leg they don't tell you what to say.Â  ~Mark Twain

A different language is a different vision of life.Â  ~Federico Fellini

If a language is corruptible, then a constitution written in that language is corruptible.Â  ~Robert Brault, www.robertbrault.com

"Children, don't speak so coarsely," said Mr. Webster, who had a vague notion that some supervision should be exercised over his daughters' speech, and that a line should be drawn, but never knew quite when to draw it.Â  He had allowed his daughters to use his library without restraint, and nothing is more fatal to maidenly delicacy of speech than the run of a good library.Â  ~Robertson Davies, Tempest Tost

The difference between Las Vegas and Atlantic City is the difference between getting conned by a beautiful call girl and getting mugged by a crack head.Â  ~Drew Carey


The secret affinity between gambling and the desert: the intensity of gambling reinforced by the presence of the desert all around the town.Â  The air-conditioned freshness of the gaming rooms, as against the radiant heat outside.Â  The challenge of all the artificial lights to the violence of the sun's rays.Â  Night of gambling sunlit on all sides; the glittering darkness of these rooms in the middle of the desert.Â  Gambling itself is a desert form, inhuman, uncultured, initiatory, a challenge to the natural economy of value, a crazed activity on the fringes of exchange.Â  But it too has a strict limit and stops abruptly; its boundaries are exact, its passion knows no confusion.Â  Neither the desert nor gambling are open areas; their spaces are finite and concentric, increasing in intensity toward the interior, toward a central point, be it the spirit of gambling or the heart of the desert - a privileged, immemorial space, where things lose their shadow, where money loses its value, and where the extreme rarity of traces of what signals to us there leads men to seek the instantaneity of wealth.Â  ~Jean Baudrillard


In the case of an earthquake hitting Las Vegas, be sure to go straight to the Keno Lounge.Â  Nothing ever gets hit there.Â  ~Author Unknown

A great poet has seldom sung of lawfully wedded happiness, but of free and secret love; and in this respect, too the time is coming when there will no longer be one standard of morality for poetry and another for life.Â  To anyone tender of conscience, the ties formed by a free connection are stronger than the legal ones.Â  ~Ellen Key, quoted by Sprading in Liberty and the Great Libertarians


Any married man should forget his mistakes - no use two people remembering the same thing.Â  ~Duane Dewel

If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.Â  ~John Louis von Neumann


Arithmetic is where the answer is right and everything is nice and you can look out of the window and see the blue sky - or the answer is wrong and you have to start over and try again and see how it comes out this time.Â  ~Carl Sandburg


Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.Â  ~Albert Einstein

[A mathematician is a] scientist who can figure out anything except such simple things as squaring the circle and trisecting an angle.Â  ~Evan Esar, Esar's Comic Dictionary


"Every minute dies a man, Every minute one is born;"Â  I need hardly point out to you that this calculation would tend to keep the sum total of the world's population in a state of perpetual equipoise, whereas it is a well-known fact that the said sum total is constantly on the increase.Â  I would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in the next edition of your excellent poem the erroneous calculation to which I refer should be corrected as follows:Â  "Every moment dies a man, And one and a sixteenth is born."Â  I may add that the exact figures are 1.067, but something must, of course, be conceded to the laws of metre.Â  ~Charles Babbage, letter to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, about a couplet in his "The Vision of Sin"


Math is radical!Â  ~Bumper Sticker


There was a blithe certainty that came from first comprehending the full Einstein field equations, arabesques of Greek letters clinging tenuously to the page, a gossamer web.Â  They seemed insubstantial when you first saw them, a string of squiggles.Â  Yet to follow the delicate tensors as they contracted, as the superscripts paired with subscripts, collapsing mathematically into concrete classical entities - potential; mass; forces vectoring in a curved geometry - that was a sublime experience.Â  The iron fist of the real, inside the velvet glove of airy mathematics.Â  ~Gregory Benford, Timescape


It is a mathematical fact that fifty percent of all doctors graduate in the bottom half of their class.Â  ~Author Unknown


If two wrongs don't make a right, try three.Â  ~Author Unknown

Even stranger things have happened; and perhaps the strangest of all is the marvel that mathematics should be possible to a race akin to the apes.Â  ~Eric T. Bell, The Development of Mathematics


So if a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, he must begin again.Â  ~Francis Bacon, "Of Studies"


The essence of mathematics is not to make simple things complicated, but to make complicated things simple.Â  ~S. Gudder

Go down deep enough into anything and you will find mathematics.Â  ~Dean Schlicter


It is not the job of mathematicians... to do correct arithmetical operations.Â  It is the job of bank accountants.Â  ~Samuil Shchatunovski


Trigonometry is a sine of the times.Â  ~Author Unknown


Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost.Â  Rigour should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere.Â  ~W.S. Anglin


A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems. ~Paul Erdos


Let us grant that the pursuit of mathematics is a divine madness of the human spirit, a refuge from the goading urgency of contingent happenings.Â  ~Alfred North Whitehead


The tantalizing and compelling pursuit of mathematical problems offers mental absorption, peace of mind amid endless challenges, repose in activity, battle without conflict, "refuge from the goading urgency of contingent happenings," and the sort of beauty changeless mountains present to sense tried by the present-day kaleidoscope of events.Â  ~Morris Kline, Mathematics in Western Culture






Mathematics is as much an aspect of culture as it is a collection of algorithms.Â  ~Carl Boyer, 1949, calculus textbook


The cowboys have a way of trussing up a steer or a pugnacious bronco which fixes the brute so that it can neither move nor think.Â  This is the hog-tie, and it is what Euclid did to geometry.Â  ~Eric Bell, The Search for Truth


Sometimes it is useful to know how large your zero is.Â  ~Author Unknown


The hardest arithmetic to master is that which enables us to count our blessings.Â  ~Eric Hoffer, Reflections On The Human Condition



Mathematics is the only good metaphysics.Â  ~William Thomson Baron Kelvin of Largs


The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.Â  Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic.Â  ~Bertrand Russell


Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting.Â  ~Gottfried Leibniz


How many times can you subtract 7 from 83, and what is left afterwards?Â  You can subtract it as many times as you want, and it leaves 76 every time.Â  ~Author Unknown


To most outsiders, modern mathematics is unknown territory.Â  Its borders are protected by dense thickets of technical terms; its landscapes are a mass of indecipherable equations and incomprehensible concepts.Â  Few realize that the world of modern mathematics is rich with vivid images and provocative ideas.Â  ~Ivars Peterson


With my full philosophical rucksack I can only climb slowly up the mountain of mathematics.Â  ~Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value

You may be an engineer if your idea of good interpersonal communication means getting the decimal point in the right place.Â  ~Author Unknown


The trouble with integers is that we have examined only the very small ones.Â  Maybe all the exciting stuff happens at really big numbers, ones we can't even begin to think about in any very definite way.Â  Our brains have evolved to get us out of the rain, find where the berries are, and keep us from getting killed.Â  Our brains did not evolve to help us grasp really large numbers or to look at things in a hundred thousand dimensions.Â  ~Ronald L. Graham


We could use up two Eternities in learning all that is to be learned about our own world and the thousands of nations that have arisen and flourished and vanished from it.Â  Mathematics alone would occupy me eight million years.Â  ~Mark Twain

Although he may not always recognize his bondage, modern man lives under a tyranny of numbers.Â  ~Nicholas Eberstadt, The Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misrule


The mathematics are usually considered as being the very antipodes of Poesy.Â  Yet Mathesis and Poesy are of the closest kindred, for they are both works of the imagination.Â  ~Thomas Hill


The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed.Â  Our authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days."Â  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.Â  The light we receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that....Â  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.Â  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E) temperature of the earth (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).Â  The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed....Â  [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and unbelieving...shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."Â  A lake of molten brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.Â  We have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.Â  ~From Applied Optics, vol. 11, A14, 1972


I used to love mathematics for its own sake, and I still do, because it allows for no hypocrisy and no vagueness.... ~Stendhal (Henri Beyle), The Life of Henri Brulard


As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.Â  ~Albert Einstein, Sidelights on Relativity


God does not care about our mathematical difficulties; He integrates empirically.Â  ~Albert Einstein


If there is a God, he's a great mathematician.Â  ~Paul Dirac


To all of us who hold the Christian belief that God is truth, anything that is true is a fact about God, and mathematics is a branch of theology.Â  ~Hilda Phoebe Hudson


[T]he different branches of Arithmetic - Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.Â  ~Lewis Carroll


[G]eometry is not true, it is advantageous.Â  ~Henri PoincarÃ©


Infinity is a floorless room without walls or ceiling.Â  ~Author Unknown


Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little; it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover.Â  ~Bertrand Russell


God is real, unless declared integer.Â  ~Author Unknown


If a healthy minded person takes an interest in science, he gets busy with his mathematics and haunts the laboratory.Â  ~W.S. Franklin


Proof is an idol before whom the pure mathematician tortures himself.Â  ~Arthur Stanley Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World


There was a young man from Trinity,
Who solved the square root of infinity.
While counting the digits,
He was seized by the fidgets,
Dropped science, and took up divinity.
~Author Unknown


One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulas have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers...Â  ~Heinrich Hertz


In the binary system we count on our fists instead of on our fingers.Â  ~Author Unknown


There are 10 types of people in this world:Â  those who understand binary and those who don't.Â  ~Author Unknown


The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God.Â  ~Euclid


In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what one has established another undoes.Â  In mathematics alone each generations adds a new story to the old structure.Â  ~Hermann Hankel


Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence.Â  Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting.Â  I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.Â  ~Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky


I know that two and two make four - & should be glad to prove it too if I could - though I must say if by any sort of process I could convert 2 & 2 into five it would give me much greater pleasure.Â  ~George Gordon, Lord Byron


Mathematics may be defined as the economy of counting.Â  There is no problem in the whole of mathematics which cannot be solved by direct counting.Â  ~Ernst Mach


Nature does not count nor do integers occur in nature.Â  Man made them all, integers and all the rest, Kronecker to the contrary notwithstanding.Â  ~Percy William Bridgman, The Way Things Are


A man has one hundred dollars and you leave him with two dollars.Â  That's subtraction.Â  ~Mae West


I've dealt with numbers all my life, of course, and after a while you begin to feel that each number has a personality of its own.Â  A twelve is very different from a thirteen, for example.Â  Twelve is upright, conscientious, intelligent, whereas thirteen is a loner, a shady character who won't think twice about breaking the law to get what he wants.Â  Eleven is tough, an outdoorsman who likes tramping through woods and scaling mountains; ten is rather simpleminded, a bland figure who always does what he's told; nine is deep and mystical, a Buddha of contemplation....Â  ~Paul Auster, The Music of Chance


Why do we believe that in all matters the odd numbers are more powerful?Â  ~Pliny the Elder, Natural History


Uneven numbers are the gods' delight.Â  ~Virgil, The Eclogues


One of the endlessly alluring aspects of mathematics is that its thorniest paradoxes have a way of blooming into beautiful theories.Â  ~Philip J. Davis


Pure mathematics is the world's best game.Â  It is more absorbing than chess, more of a gamble than poker, and lasts longer than Monopoly.Â  It's free.Â  It can be played anywhere - Archimedes did it in a bathtub.Â  ~Richard J. Trudeau, Dots and Lines


I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe - because like Spinoza's God, it won't love us in return.Â  ~Bertrand Russell, 1912


The man ignorant of mathematics will be increasingly limited in his grasp of the main forces of civilization.Â  ~John Kemeny


Although I am almost illiterate mathematically, I grasped very early in life that any one who can count to ten can count upward indefinitely if he is fool enough to do so.Â  ~Robertson Davies, "Of the Conservation of Youth," The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks


A million thanks to Norm & Andy for submitting some of these quotes!

In the spider-web of facts, many a truth is strangled.Â  ~Paul Eldridge

Editor:Â  A person employed on a newspaper whose business it is to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to see that the chaff is printed.Â  ~Elbert Hubbard

In the real world, the right thing never happens in the right place and the right time.Â  It is the job of journalists and historians to make it appear that it has.Â  ~Mark Twain

I fear three newspapers more than a hundred thousand bayonets.Â  ~Napoleon

You don't realize how little accuracy there is in network TV reporting until they cover a story in your hometown.Â  ~Robert Brault, www.robertbrault.com

The secret of successful journalism is to make your readers so angry they will write half your paper for you.Â  ~C.E.M. Joad

Journalism is organized gossip.Â  ~Edward Egglestone

A newspaper, as I'm sure you know, is a collection of supposedly true stories written down by writers who either saw them happen or talked to people who did.Â  These writers are called journalists, and like telephone operators, butchers, ballerinas, and people who clean up after horses, journalists can sometimes make mistakes.Â  ~Lemony Snicket

Literature is the art of writing something that will be read twice; journalism what will be grasped at once.Â  ~Cyril Connolly

The faculty of attention has utterly vanished from the Anglo-Saxon mind, extinguished at its source by the big bayadÃ¨re of journalism, of the newspaper and the picture magazine which keeps screaming, "Look at me."Â  Illustrations, loud simplifications... bill poster advertising - only these stand a chance.Â  ~Henry James

Television has a real problem.Â  They have no page two.Â  Consequently every big story gets the same play and comes across to the viewer as a really big, scary one.Â  ~Art Buchwald, 1969

If you don't read the newspaper, you are uninformed.Â  If you do read the newspaper, you are misinformed.Â  ~Author unknown, commonly attributed to Mark Twain or Thomas Jefferson

I do not mean to be the slightest bit critical of TV newspeople, who do a superb job, considering that they operate under severe time constraints and have the intellectual depth of hamsters.Â  But TV news can only present the "bare bones" of a story; it takes a newspaper, with its capability to present vast amounts of information, to render the story truly boring.Â  ~Dave Barry

The bigger the information media, the less courage and freedom they allow.Â  Bigness means weakness.Â  ~Eric Sevareid, "The Press and the People," television program, 1959

No price is set on the lavish summer;
June may be had by the poorest comer.

Fieldes have eies and woods have eares.Â  ~John Heywood, 1565

There is no right way to knit; there is no wrong way to knit.Â  So if anybody kindly tells you that what you are doing is "wrong," don't take umbrage; they mean well.Â  Smile submissively, and listen, keeping your disagreement on an entirely mental level.Â  They may be right, in this particular case, and even if not, they may drop off pieces of information which will come in very handy if you file them away carefully in your brain for future reference.Â  ~Elizabeth Zimmerman

And ye, who have met with Adversity's blast,
And been bow'd to the earth by its fury;
To whom the Twelve Months, that have recently pass'd

The regrets of remembrance to cozen,
And having obtained a New Trial of Time,
Shout in hopes of a kindlier dozen.

we look upon the yearly wine
to see our substance in the lees.

then see the vat at mirror's face
and find in it, the yearly pace.
~E. Marshall, Vintner Epilogue (Happy Old Year)

Many years ago I resolved never to bother with New Year's resolutions, and I've stuck with it ever since.Â  ~Dave Beard

I do think New Year's resolutions can't technically be expected to begin on New Year's Day, don't you?Â  Since, because it's an extension of New Year's Eve, smokers are already on a smoking roll and cannot be expected to stop abruptly on the stroke of midnight with so much nicotine in the system.Â  Also dieting on New Year's Day isn't a good idea as you can't eat rationally but really need to be free to consume whatever is necessary, moment by moment, in order to ease your hangover.Â  I think it would be much more sensible if resolutions began generally on January the second.Â  ~Helen Fielding, Bridget Jones's Diary

It wouldn't be New Year's if I didn't have regrets.Â  ~William Thomas

We spend January 1 walking through our lives, room by room, drawing up a list of work to be done, cracks to be patched.Â   Maybe this year, to balance the list, we ought to walk through the rooms of our lives... not looking for flaws, but for potential.Â  ~Ellen Goodman

May all your troubles last as long as your New Year's resolutions.Â  ~Joey Adams

He who breaks a resolution is a weakling;
He who makes one is a fool.
~F.M. Knowles

The object of a New Year is not that we should have a new year.Â  It is that we should have a new soul and a new nose; new feet, a new backbone, new ears, and new eyes.Â  Unless a particular man made New Year resolutions, he would make no resolutions.Â  Unless a man starts afresh about things, he will certainly do nothing effective.Â  ~G.K. Chesterton

I think in terms of the day's resolutions, not the year's.Â  ~Henry Moore

Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunder-storm or blare of trumpets to announce the beginning of a new month or year.Â  Even when a new century begins it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols.Â  ~Thomas Mann

Why won't they let a year die without bringing in a new one on the instant, can't they use birth control on time?Â  I want an interregnum.Â  The stupid years patter on with unrelenting feet, never stopping - rising to little monotonous peaks in our imaginations at festivals like New Year's and Easter and Christmas - But, goodness, why need they do it?Â  ~John Dos Passos, 1917

New Year's is a harmless annual institution, of no particular use to anybody save as a scapegoat for promiscuous drunks, and friendly calls and humbug resolutions.Â  ~Mark Twain

Every man regards his own life as the New Year's Eve of time.Â  ~Jean Paul Richter

The only way to spend New Year's Eve is either quietly with friends or in a brothel.Â  Otherwise when the evening ends and people pair off, someone is bound to be left in tears.Â  ~W.H. Auden

Night time is really the best time to work.Â  All the ideas are there to be yours because everyone else is asleep.Â  ~Catherine O'Hara

There they stand, the innumerable stars, shining in order like a living hymn, written in light.Â  ~N.P. Willis

I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.Â  ~Vincent Van Gogh

Mine is the night, with all her stars.Â  ~Edward Young

One summer night, out on a flat headland, all but surrounded by the waters of the bay, the horizons were remote and distant rims on the edge of space.Â  Millions of stars blazed in darkness, and on the far shore a few lights burned in cottages.Â  Otherwise there was no reminder of human life.Â  My companion and I were alone with the stars:Â  the misty river of the Milky Way flowing across the sky, the patterns of the constellations standing out bright and clear, a blazing planet low on the horizon.Â  It occurred to me that if this were a sight that could be seen only once in a century, this little headland would be thronged with spectators.Â  But it can be seen many scores of nights in any year, and so the lights burned in the cottages and the inhabitants probably gave not a thought to the beauty overhead; and because they could see it almost any night, perhaps they never will.Â  ~Rachel Carson

If the Stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown!Â  But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.Â  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson

A tongue in every star that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wise? nor wooes in vain;
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
~Anna Letitia Barbauld, A Summer Evening's Meditation

Night is the blotting paper for many sorrows.Â  ~Author Unknown

Learn to reverence night and to put away the vulgar fear of it, for, with the banishment of night from the experience of man, there vanishes as well a religious emotion, a poetic mood, which gives depth to the adventure of humanity.Â  ~Henry Beston

When the moon, after covering herself with darkness as in sorrow, at last throws off the garments of her widowhood, she does not at once expose herself impudently to the public gaze; but for a time remains veiled in a transparent cloud, till she gradually acquires courage to endure the looks and admiration of beholders.Â  ~Augustus William Hare and Julius Charles Hare, Guesses at Truth, by Two Brothers, 1827

A star might shine from dusk to rosy morn....

All ten thousand miles at once in its light!

There is one armor that the world of men and women, as a world, has never yet put on.Â  The churches have long bungled with its fastenings, but the world has gone unfended, and few have been those in whose hands the mystical sword of the spirit has shone with daily use.Â  This armor, waiting to be worn, is the armor of brotherhood and sacrifice, the world of unselfishness, a conquering sword, with the power, where used, to unite the world in love.Â  And there are none who may not put it on.Â  ~M.A. DeWolfe Howe

Boiled turnip will a roasted pullet be.

The world always makes the assumption that the exposure of an error is identical with the discovery of truth - that the error and truth are simply opposite.Â  They are nothing of the sort.Â  What the world turns to, when it is cured on one error, is usually simply another error, and maybe one worse than the first one.Â  ~H.L. Mencken

The distinction between historian and poet is not in the one writing prose and the other verse... the one describes the thing that has been, and the other a kind of thing that might be.Â  Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.Â  ~Aristotle, On Poetics

A poet is an unhappy being whose heart is torn by secret sufferings, but whose lips are so strangely formed that when the sighs and the cries escape them, they sound like beautiful music... and then people crowd about the poet and say to him:Â  "Sing for us soon again;" that is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul."Â  ~Soren Kierkegaard

Your best chance to get a Royal Flush in a casino is in the bathroom.Â  ~V.P. Pappy


There are few things that are so unpardonably neglected in our country as poker.Â  The upper class knows very little about it.Â  Now and then you find ambassadors who have sort of a general knowledge of the game, but the ignorance of the people is fearful.Â  Why, I have known clergymen, good men, kind-hearted, liberal, sincere, and all that, who did not know the meaning of a "flush."Â  It is enough to make one ashamed of the species.Â  ~Mark Twain

God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of his own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e., everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.Â  ~Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, Good Omens, 1991

[Poker is] as elaborate a waste of human intelligence as you could find outside an advertising agency.Â  ~Raymond Chandler


You have it in your power to turn a bad-beat around simply by realizing this simple truth:Â  The more bad beats you encounter, the luckier you are.Â  It's a sign that you are playing against opponents who continually take the worst of it, and if you can't beat someone who always takes the worst of it, you can't beat anyone.Â  ~Lou Krieger


Old card players never die, they just shuffle away.Â  ~Author Unknown


Industry executives and analysts often mistakenly talk about strategy as if it were some kind of chess match.Â  But in chess, you have just two opponents, each with identical resources, and with luck playing a minimal role.Â  The real world is much more like a poker game, with multiple players trying to make the best of whatever hand fortune has dealt them.Â  In our industry, Bill Gates owns the table until someone proves otherwise.Â  ~David Moschella


Most of the money you'll win at poker comes not from the brilliance of your own play, but from the ineptitude of your opponents.Â  ~Lou Krieger

I've often thought, if I got really hungry for a good milk shake, how much would I pay for one?Â  People will pay a hundred dollars for a bottle of wine; to me that's not worth it.Â   But I'm not going to say it is foolish or wrong to spend that kind of money, if that's what you want.Â  So if a guy wants to bet twenty or thirty thousand dollars in a poker game, that is his privilege.Â  ~Jack Binion


There's opportunity in poker.... If Horace Greeley were alive today, his advice wouldn't be "Go West, young man, and grow up with the country."Â  Instead, he'd point to that deck of cards on table and say, "Shuffle up and deal.Â  ~Lou Krieger

You can't get rid of poverty by giving people money.Â  ~P.J. O'Rourke, A Parliament of Whores


The poverty of our century is unlike that of any other.Â  It is not, as poverty was before, the result of natural scarcity, but of a set of priorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich.Â  Consequently, the modern poor are not pitied...but written off as trash.Â  The twentieth-century consumer economy has produced the first culture for which a beggar is a reminder of nothing.Â  ~John Berger

Still more majestic grows thy fame.

His life was a hymn in praise of honor, uprightness, and patriotism.Â  ~Orestes Ferrara

Washington's is the mightiest name of earth - long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty; still mightiest in moral reformation.Â  On that name no eulogy is expected.Â  It cannot be.Â  To add brightness to the sun, or glory to the name of Washington, is alike impossible.Â  Let none attempt it.Â  In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life, and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine.Â  ~Thomas Jefferson

The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.Â  ~Thomas Jefferson

A capacity, and taste, for reading, gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others.Â  It is the key, or one of the keys, to the already solved problems.Â  And not only so.Â  It gives a relish, and facility, for successfully pursuing the unsolved ones.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Discourage litigation.Â  Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can.Â  Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser - in fees, expenses, and waste of time.Â  As a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man.Â  There will still be business enough.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

I am rather inclined to silence, and whether that be wise or not, it is at least more unusual nowadays to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

I leave you, hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital.Â  Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.Â  Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

There are no accidents in my philosophy.Â  Every effect must have its cause.Â  The past is the cause of the present, and the present will be the cause of the future.Â  All these are links in the endless chain stretching from the finite to the infinite.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

We are not enemies, but friends.Â  We must not be enemies.Â  Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.Â  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

What is conservatism?Â  Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Whenever I hear any one arguing for slavery I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Labor disgraces no man; unfortunately, you occasionally find men who disgrace labor.Â  ~Ulysses S. Grant

The lesson of history is rarely learned by the actors themselves.Â  ~James A. Garfield

It is well that you should celebrate your Arbor Day thoughtfully, for within your lifetime the nation's need of trees will become serious. We of an older generation can get along with what we have, though with growing hardship; but in your full manhood and womanhood you will want what nature once so bountifully supplied and man so thoughtlessly destroyed; and because of that want you will reproach us, not for what we have used, but for what we have wasted.Â  ~Theodore Roosevelt, 1907 Arbor Day Message

A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.Â  ~Theodore Roosevelt

I would never read a book if it were possible for me to talk half an hour with the man who wrote it.Â  ~Woodrow Wilson

The flag of the United States has not been created by rhetorical sentences in declarations of independence and in bills of rights.Â  It has been created by the experience of a great people, and nothing is written upon it that has not been written by their life.Â  It is the embodiment, not of a sentiment, but of a history.Â  ~Woodrow Wilson

The American Revolution was a beginning, not a consummation.Â  ~Woodrow Wilson

I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow.Â  ~Woodrow Wilson

A conservative is a man who just sits and thinks, mostly sits.Â  ~Woodrow Wilson

Golf is a game in which one endeavors to control a ball with implements ill adapted for the purpose.Â  ~Woodrow Wilson

We cannot do everything at once, but we can do something at once.Â  ~Calvin Coolidge

We seek peace, knowing that peace is the climate of freedom.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.Â  This world in arms is not spending money alone.Â  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.Â  This is not a way of life at all in any true sense.Â  Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower, speech, American Society of Newspaper Editors, 16 April 1953

The problem in defense is how far you can go without destroying from within what you are trying to defend from without.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower

Freedom has its life in the hearts, the actions, the spirit of men and so it must be daily earned and refreshed - else like a flower cut from its life-giving roots, it will wither and die.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower

What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower

A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower, first inaugural address, 20 January 1953

I am sorry to say that there is too much point to the wisecrack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

Conformity is that jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

We are inclined that if we watch a football game or baseball game, we have taken part in it.Â  ~John F. Kennedy, 1961

As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

Modern cynics and skeptics... see no harm in paying those to whom they entrust the minds of their children a smaller wage than is paid to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

Too often we... enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.Â  ~John F. Kennedy

I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy.Â  First, let her think she's having her own way.Â  And second, let her have it.Â  ~Lyndon B. Johnson

Freedom is not enough.Â  ~Lyndon B. Johnson

If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River, the headline that afternoon would read:Â  "President Can't Swim."Â  ~Lyndon B. Johnson

I know I am getting better at golf because I'm hitting fewer spectators.Â  ~Gerald Ford

I would like to deny all allegations by Bob Hope that during my last game of golf, I hit an eagle, a birdie, an elk and a moose.Â  ~Gerald Ford

America did not invent human rights.Â  In a very real sense... human rights invented America.Â  ~Jimmy Carter

I couldn't help but say to [Mr. Gorbachev], just think how easy his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another planet.Â  [We'd] find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this earth together.Â  ~Ronald Reagan, 1985

The taxpayer - that's someone who works for the federal government but doesn't have to take
the civil service examination.Â  ~Ronald Reagan

The days a man spends fishing or spends hunting should not be deducted from the time that he's on earth.Â  In other words, if I fish today, that should be added to the amount of time I get to live.Â  That's the way I look at recreation.Â  That's why I'll be a big conservation, environmental President, because I plan to fish and hunt as much as I possibly can.Â  ~George Bush, quoted in Los Angeles Times, 30 December 1988

We cannot blame the schools alone for the dismal decline in SAT verbal scores.Â  When our kids come home from school do they pick up a book or do they sit glued to the tube, watching music videos?Â  Parents, don't make the mistake of thinking your kid only learns between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.Â  ~George Bush

There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.Â  ~William J. Clinton

The real differences around the world today are not between Jews and Arabs; Protestants and Catholics; Muslims, Croats, and Serbs.Â  The real differences are between those who embrace peace and those who would destroy it; between those who look to the future and those who cling to the past; between those who open their arms and those who are determined to clench their fists.Â  ~William J. Clinton, 1997

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.Â  ~Martin Golding

Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place.Â  So if you are as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?Â  ~Brian Kernighan

Sometimes it pays to stay in bed in Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code.Â  ~Dan Salomon

[A]nd then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things.Â  They are, in short, a perfect match.Â  ~Bill Bryson

Another effective technique is to explain your code to someone else.Â  This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself.Â  Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed "Never mind, I see what's wrong.Â  Sorry to bother you."Â  This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.Â  One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.Â  Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor.Â  ~Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike, about debugging

A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.Â  ~Doug Linder

All programmers are optimists.Â  Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers.Â  Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal.Â  Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.Â  ~Frederick Brooks,Â Jr.

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.Â  Good programmers write code that humans can understand.Â  ~Martin Fowler

Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.Â  ~Rich Kulawiec

From a programmer's point of view, the user is a peripheral that types when you issue a read request.Â  ~Peter Williams

At Group L, Stoffel oversees six first-rate programmers, a managerial challenge roughly equivalent to herding cats.Â  ~The Washington Post Magazine, 9 June 1985

It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature.Â  ~Author Unknown

Version 1 of any software is full of bugs.Â  Version 2 fixes all the bugs and is great.Â  Version 3 adds all the things users ask for, but hides all the great stuff in Version 2.Â  ~Fred Blechman

Writing the first 90 percent of a computer program takes 90 percent of the time.Â  The remaining ten percent also takes 90 percent of the time and the final touches also take 90 percent of the time.Â  ~N.J. Rubenking

Good code is its own best documentation.Â  As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?"Â  ~Steve McConnell

Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty.Â  If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too.Â  I'm not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way.Â  It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.Â  ~Paul Graham, "Hackers and Painters," 2003

I really hate this darn machine;
I wish that they would sell it.
It won't do what I want it to,
but only what I tell it.

One man's crappy software is another man's full time job.Â  ~Jessica Gaston

He who hasn't hacked assembly language as a youth has no heart.Â  He who does so as an adult has no brain.Â  ~John Moore

If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.Â  ~Edsger Dijkstra

If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, e.g., with no external memory aids, you are not ready to code it.Â  ~Richard Pattis

It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure.Â  Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.Â  ~Nathaniel S. Borenstein

It's easy to cry "bug" when the truth is that you've got a complex system and sometimes it takes a while to get all the components to co-exist peacefully.Â  ~Doug Vargas

It's okay to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn't need to figure out code.Â  You should be able to read it.Â  ~Steve McConnell

It's the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist.Â  There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking.Â  On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.Â  ~Andy Hertzfeld, about programming

We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:Â  premature optimization is the root of all evil.Â  ~C.A.R. Hoare, quoted by Donald Knuth

Programming is like sex.Â  One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.Â  ~Michael Sinz

Programming is similar to a game of golf.Â  The point is not getting the ball in the hole but how many strokes it takes.Â  ~Harlan Mills

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.Â  ~Author Unknown

Programming languages, like pizzas, come in only two sizes:Â  too big and too small.Â  ~Richard Pattis

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots.Â  So far, the Universe is winning.Â  ~Rich Cook

Programs for sale:Â  fast, reliable, cheap - choose two.Â  ~Author Unknown

Ready, fire, aim:Â  the fast approach to software development.Â  Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim:Â  the slow approach to software development.Â  ~Author Unknown

Reusing pieces of code is like picking off sentences from other people's stories and trying to make a magazine article.Â  ~Bob Frankston

Program, n.Â  A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error messages; v. tr. To engage in a pastime similar to banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer opportunities for reward.Â  ~Author Unknown

Should array indices start at 0 or 1?Â  My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.Â  ~Stan Kelly-Bootle

The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state.Â  ~J.Â Osterhout

The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.Â  One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.... The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too.Â  If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work.Â  Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it.Â  Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.Â  ~Frederick Brooks

The only way for errors to occur in a program is by being put there by the author.Â  No other mechanisms are known.Â  Programs can't acquire bugs by sitting around with other buggy programs.Â  ~Harlan Mills

Errors have occurred.
We won't tell you where or why.
Lazy programmers.
~Charlie Gibbs,  1998, honorable mention in the Haiku Error Messages 21st Challenge by Charlie Varon and Jim Rosenau, sponsored by Salon.com

There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.Â  ~Alan J. Perlis

One man's constant is another man's variable.Â  ~Alan J. Perlis

There does not now, nor will there ever exist, a programming language in which it is the least bit hard to write bad programs.Â  ~Lawrence Flon

We don't manage our time as well as we manage our space.Â  There's an overhead of starting and an overhead of stopping a project because you kind of lose your momentum.Â  And you've got to bracket and put aside all the things you're already doing.Â  So you need reasonably large blocks of uninterrupted time if you're going to be successful at doing some of these things.Â  That's why hackers tend to stay up late.Â  If you stay up late and you have another hour of work to do, you can just stay up another hour later without running into a wall and having to stop.Â  Whereas it might take three or four hours if you start over, you might finish if you just work that extra hour.Â  If you're a morning person, the day always intrudes a fixed amount of time in the future.Â  So it's much less efficient.Â  Which is why I think computer people tend to be night people - because a machine doesn't get sleepy.Â  ~Bill Joy

When a programming language is created that allows programmers to program in simple English, it will be discovered that programmers cannot speak English.Â  ~Author Unknown

When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code.Â  ~Richard Pattis

When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs.Â  Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:Â  you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in your hand.Â  ~Paul Graham, "The Other Road Ahead," 2001

You cannot teach beginners top-down programming, because they don't know which end is up.Â  ~C.A.R. Hoare

In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.Â  ~Alan J. Perlis

The New Testament offers the basis for modern computer coding theory, in the form of an affirmation of the binary number system.Â  "But let your communication be Yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil."Â  Matthew 5:37Â  ~Author Unknown

What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else.Â  That forces you to sort it out in your own mind.Â  And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas.Â  And that's really the essence of programming.Â  By the time you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you've certainly learned something about it yourself.Â  ~Douglas Adams

To have a grievance is to have a purpose in life.Â  ~Alan Coren, The Sanity Inspector, 1974

This is a little prayer dedicated to the separation of church and state.Â  I guess if they are going to force those kids to pray in schools they might as well have a nice prayer like this:Â  Our Father who art in heaven, and to the republic for which it stands, thy kingdom come, one nation indivisible as in heaven, give us this day as we forgive those who so proudly we hail.Â  Crown thy good into temptation but deliver us from the twilight's last gleaming.Â  Amen and Awomen.Â  ~George Carlin

Man is a Religious Animal.Â  He is the only Religious Animal.Â  He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them.Â  He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight.Â  He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven.Â  ~Mark Twain


Traveler:Â  "God has been mighty good to your fields, Mr. Farmer."

It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God.Â  It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.Â  ~Thomas Jefferson

When lip service to some mysterious deity permits bestiality on Wednesday and absolution on Sunday, cash me out.Â  ~Frank Sinatra

There were honest people long before there were Christians and there are, God be praised, still honest people where there are no Christians.Â  It could therefore easily be possible that people are Christians because true Christianity corresponds to what they would have been even if Christianity did not exist.Â  ~G.C. Lichtenberg

Scriptures:Â  the sacred books of our holy religion, as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based.Â  ~Ambrose Bierce


"I refuse to prove that I exist" says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith, I am nothing."Â  "Oh," says man, "but the Babel Fish is a dead give-away, isn't it?Â  It proves You exist, and so therefore You don't.Â  Q.E.D."Â  "Oh, I hadn't thought of that," says God, who promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.Â  ~Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Impiety, n.:Â  Your irreverence toward my deity.Â  ~Ambrose Bierce


There is a story, which is fairly well known, about when the missionaries came to Africa.Â  They had the Bible and we, the natives, had the land.Â  They said "Let us pray," and we dutifully shut our eyes.Â  When we opened them, why, they now had the land and we had the Bible.Â  ~Desmond M. Tutu, "Religious Human Rights and the Bible"


A myth is a religion in which no one any longer believes.Â  ~James Feibleman, Understanding Philosophy, 1973

The faith that stands on authority is not faith.Â   ~Ralph Waldo Emerson


All religion, my friend, is simply evolved out of fraud, fear, greed, imagination, and poetry.Â  ~Edgar Allen Poe


On religious issues there can be little or no compromise.Â  There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs.Â  There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being.Â  But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly.Â  The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom.Â  They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent.Â  If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both.Â  I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in A, B, C, and D.Â  Just who do they think they are?Â  And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me?Â  And I am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll call in the Senate.Â  I am warning them today:Â  I will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of conservatism.Â  ~Barry Goldwater


People who rely most on God rely least on themselves.Â  ~Lemuel K. Washburn, Is The Bible Worth Reading And Other Essays

Each religion, by the help of more or less myth which it takes more or less seriously, proposes some method of fortifying the human soul and enabling it to make its peace with its destiny.Â  ~George Santayana


The world is not a prison house but a kind of spiritual kindergarten where millions of bewildered infants are trying to spell God with the wrong blocks.Â  ~Edwin Arlington Robinson


To crush out fanaticism and revere the infinite, such is the law.Â  Let us not confine ourselves to falling prostrate beneath the tree of creation and contemplating its vast ramifications full of stars.Â  We have a duty to perform, to cultivate the human soul, to defend mystery against miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and to reject the absurd; to admit nothing that is inexplicable excepting what is necessary, to purify faith and obliterate superstition from the face of religion, to remove the vermin from the garden of God.Â  ~Victor Hugo


It will not do to investigate the subject of religion too closely, as it is apt to lead to infidelity.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln, quoted in What Great Men Think Of Religion by Ira Cardiff


Faith, indeed, has up to the present not been able to move real mountains.... But it can put mountains where there are none.Â  ~Friedrich Nietzche, Human, All Too Human, 1879

The Bible is literature, not dogma.Â  ~George Santayana

What has been the effect of religious coercion?Â  To make half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites.Â  ~Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, 1785


The act of bellringing is symbolic of all proselytizing religions.Â  It implies the pointless interference with the quiet of other people.Â  ~Ezra Pound


In general, the churches, visited by me often on weekdays... bore for me the same relation to God that billboards did to Coca-Cola; they promoted thirst without quenching it.Â  ~John Updike, A Month of Sundays, 1975


Most people are bothered by those passages of Scripture they do not understand, but the passages that bother me are those I do understand.Â  ~Mark Twain


In religion and politics, people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination.Â  ~Mark Twain


If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words.Â  I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.Â  ~Isaac Asimov, I.Â  Asimov:Â  A Memoir


Religion has not civilized man, man has civilized religion.Â  ~Robert Green Ingersoll


God - but a word invoked to explain the world.Â  ~Prat de Lamartine

How can the Church be received as a trustworthy guide in the invisible, which falls into so many errors in the visible?Â  ~John W. Draper


Men rarely (if ever) manage to dream up a god superior to themselves.Â  Most gods have the manners and morals of a spoiled child.Â  ~Robert Heinlein, Notebooks of Lazarus Long


The Theologian is an owl, sitting on an old dead branch in the tree of human knowledge, and hooting the same old hoots that have been hooted for hundreds and thousands of years, but he has never given a hoot for progress.Â  ~Emmet F. Fields


When a man really believes that it is necessary to do a certain thing to be happy forever, or that a certain belief is necessary to ensure eternal joy, there is in that man no spirit of concession.Â  He divides the whole world into saints and sinners, into believers and unbelievers, into God's sheep and Devil's goats, into people who will be glorified and people who are damned.Â  ~Robert Ingersoll, Some Reasons Why


Religions are like farts.Â  Yours is good, but everyone else's stinks.Â  ~Picket Fences


Geology shows that fossils are of different ages.Â  Paleontology shows a fossil sequence, the list of species represented changes through time.Â  Taxonomy shows biological relationships among species.Â  Evolution is the explanation that threads it all together.Â  Creationism is the practice of squeezing one's eyes shut and wailing "Does not!"Â  ~Author Unknown


We are not accountable for the sins of Adam.Â  ~Robert G. Ingersoll


The third major characteristic of God - "infinitude" - is the catchall, the universal modifier of Christian theology.Â  God is not merely a being; he is infinite being.Â  God is not merely good; he is infinite goodness.Â  God is not merely wise; he is infinite wisdom.Â  And so on down the list.Â  God is exaggeration run amuck.Â  ~George H. Smith, Atheism:Â  The Case Against God


We must respect the other fellow's religion, but only in the same sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart.Â  ~H.L. Mencken


[The true Indian] sees no need for setting apart one day in seven as a holy day, because to him all days are God's days.Â  The first American mingled with his pride a singular humility.Â  Spiritual arrogance was foreign to his nature and teaching.Â  ~Ohiyesa of the Santee Sioux (Charles Alexander Eastman)


On the sixth day God created man.Â  On the seventh day, man returned the favor.Â  ~Author Unknown


If God has created us in His image, we have more than returned the compliment.Â  ~Voltaire

God is innocent.Â  Noah built in a flood plain.Â  ~Author Unknown


To listen to some devout people, one would imagine that God never laughs.Â  ~Ghose Aurobindo


Nowhere is there an account or portrait of Christ laughing... he is always stern, serious and as gloomy as a prison guard.Â  Never does one see him laughing until tears appear in his eyes like the roly-poly squint-eyed Buddha guffawing with arms upraised.Â  ~Author Unknown


The total absence of humor from the Bible is one of the most singular things in all literature.Â  ~Alfred North Whitehead


Christendom has done away with Christianity without being quite aware of it.Â  ~Soren Kierkegaard, Time, 16 December 1946

It is impossible to believe that the same God who permitted His own son to die a bachelor regards celibacy as an actual sin.Â  ~H.L. Mencken


On the other hand, the Bible contains much that is relevant today, like Noah taking forty days to find a place to park.Â  ~Curtis McDougall


An infinite God ought to be able to protect Himself, without going in partnership with State Legislatures.Â  ~Robert Ingersoll, quoted in Ingersoll the Magnificent


Religion supports nobody.Â  It has to be supported.Â  It produces no wheat, no corn; it ploughs no land; it fells no forests.Â  It is a perpetual mendicant.Â  It lives on the labors of others, and then has the arrogance to pretend that it supports the giver.Â  ~Robert G. Ingersoll


Christianity is not a religion; it's an industry.Â  ~Author Unknown


It is an old habit with theologians to beat the living with the bones of the dead.Â  ~Robert G. Ingersoll


In an early class, one of the students asked me if I believed in God.Â  I replied, 'I don't think so.'Â  And then proceeded to wail on the theme, using material from this column of some weeks ago, in which I observed the perpetuation of insanity on this planet through the mediums of Arabs-vs-Jews, Catholics-vs-Protestants, Southern Baptists-vs-Everyone.Â  I said I felt if 'God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he them,' (Genesis 2:27, King James's italics, not mine) then we were God.Â  And when Man (my capitalization, not King James's) in his most creative, his most loving, his most gentle and most human, then he is most God-like.Â  The student said he would pray for my immortal soul.Â  He also asked for my address, so he could send me some literature on the subject of God.Â  I thanked him politely and told him I'd gotten all the literature I could handle on the subject from a certain Thomas Aquinas.Â  ~Harlan Ellison


Gods are fragile things; they may be killed by a whiff of science or a dose of common sense.Â  ~Chapman Cohen


I think I'll believe in Gosh instead of God.Â  If you don't believe in Gosh too, you'll be darned to heck.Â  ~Author Unknown


Devout believers are safeguarded in a high degree against the risk of certain neurotic illnesses; their acceptance of the universal neurosis spares them the task of constructing a personal one.Â  ~Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion


The Church has its problems, but the older I get, the more comfort I find there.Â  ~Bono


He was an embittered atheist, the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him.Â  ~George Orwell


God is dead:Â  but considering the state Man is in, there will perhaps be caves, for ages yet, in which his shadow will be shown.Â  ~Friedrich Neitzsche


None of us can boast about the morality of our ancestors.Â  The records do not show that Adam and Eve were married.Â  ~Ed Howe


In science, "fact" can only mean "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent."Â  I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.Â  ~Stephen J. Gould


The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one.Â  ~George Bernard Shaw


Church tax exemption means that we all drop our money in the collection boxes, whether we go to church or not and whether we are interested in the church or not.Â  It is systematic and complete robbery, from which none of us escapes.Â  ~E. Haldeman-Julius, The Church Is a Burden, Not a Benefit, In Social Life

A great deal of what passes for current Christianity consists in denouncing other people's vices and faults.Â  ~Henry H. Williams


The point is, could God pass an examination in Theology?Â  ~Malcolm Muggeridge



The idea of an incarnation of God is absurd:Â  why should the human race think itself so superior to bees, ants, and elephants as to be put in this unique relation to its maker?... Christians are like a council of frogs in a marsh or a synod of worms on a dung-hill croaking and squeaking "for our sakes was the world created."Â  ~Julian the Apostate


Jesus saves... passes to Moses... shoots... scores!Â  ~Author Unknown


Give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day; give him a religion, and he'll starve to death while praying for a fish.Â  ~Author Unknown






They were allowed to stay there on one condition, and that is that they didn't eat of the tree of knowledge.Â  That has been the condition of the Christian church from then until now.Â  They haven't eaten as yet, as a rule they do not.Â  ~Clarence Darrow


To hear many religious people talk, one would think God created the torso, head, legs and arms, but the devil slapped on the genitals.Â  ~Don Schrader


Rivers, ponds, lakes and streams - they all have different names, but they all contain water.Â  Just as religions do - they all contain truths.Â  ~Muhammad Ali


A long and wicked life followed by five minutes of perfect grace gets you into Heaven.Â  An equally long life of decent living and good works followed by one outburst of taking the name of the Lord in vain - then have a heart attack at that moment and be damned for eternity.Â  Is that the system?Â  ~Robert A. Heinlein


God tells Adam and Eve not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.Â  If this was the only way they could understand the difference between good and evil, how could they have known that it was wrong to disobey God and eat the fruit?Â  ~Laurie Lynn


A converted cannibal is one who, on Friday, eats only fishermen.Â  ~Emily Lotney

Those people who tell me that I'm going to hell while they are going to heaven somehow make me very glad that we're going to separate destinations.Â  ~Martin Terman


Inspiration:Â  a peculiar effect of divine flatulence emitted by the Holy Spirit which hisses into the ears of a few chosen of God.Â  ~Voltaire

Religion seems to have a way of making people abandon logic.Â  ~Amanda Baxter


So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence.Â  ~Bertrand Russell


You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion.Â  Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly.Â  It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.Â  ~Aldous Huxley


Christianity tells people to repent and promises them forgiveness.Â  It therefore has nothing (as far as I know) to say to people who do not know they have done anything to repent of and who do not feel that they need forgiveness.Â  ~C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity


One cannot erect, on the basis of a motive that exists only for a very few, an obligation that shall apply to everyone.Â  ~Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion


The Cross is a gibbet - rather an odd thing to make use of as a talisman against bad luck, if that is how we regard it.Â  Or is it, instead, a cynical reminder that Virtue usually gets pilloried whenever it makes one of its occasional appearances in this world?Â  ~Denis Johnston, The Brazen Horn


God has always resembled his creators.Â  He hated and loved what they hated and loved and he was invariably found on the side of those in power.Â  ~Robert G. Ingersoll


A thorough reading and understanding of the Bible is the surest path to atheism.Â  ~Donald Morgan



I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.Â  ~Frederick Douglass, escaped slave


[A]ll deities reside in the human breast.Â  ~William Blake, "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"


Life in Lubbock, Texas, taught me two things:Â  One is that God loves you and you're going to burn in hell.Â  The other is that sex is the most awful, filthy thing on earth and you should save it for someone you love.Â  ~Butch Hancock


The Bible looks like it started out as a game of Mad Libs.Â  ~Bill Maher


Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from a religious conviction.Â  ~Pascal, Pensees, 1670


The observances of the church concerning feasts and fasts are tolerably well-kept, since the rich keep the feasts and the poor keep the fasts.Â  ~Sydney Smith


A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism.Â  ~Carl Sagan


The imaginary flowers of religion adorn man's chains.Â  Man must throw off the flowers and also the chains.Â  ~Karl Marx, The Wisdom of Karl Marx



Strange...a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; mouths Golden Rules and forgiveness multiplied seventy times seven and invented Hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him!Â  ~Mark Twain, The Mysterious Stranger


It was subtle of God to learn Greek when he wished to become an author - and not to learn it better.Â  ~Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 1886

Jesus picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organization that conquered the world.Â  ~Bruce Barton




The problem with fundamentalists insisting on a literal interpretation of the Bible is that the meaning of words change.Â  A prime example is 'Spare the rod, spoil the child.'Â  A rod was a stick used by shepherds to guide their sheep to go in the desired direction.Â  Shepherds did not use it to beat their sheep.Â  The proper translation of the saying is 'Give your child guidance, or they will go astray.'Â  It does not mean 'Beat the shit out of your child or he will become rotten' as many fundamentalist parents seem to belive.Â  ~Author Unknown

The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action.Â  ~Albert Einstein


If the sole reason why you must not kill your neighbour is because God has forbidden it and will severely punish you for it in this or the next life - then, when you learn that there is no God and that you need not fear His punishment, you will certainly kill your neighbour without hesitation, and you can only be prevented from doing so by mundane force.Â  Thus either these dangerous masses must be held down most severely and kept most carefully away from any chance of intellectual awakening, or else the relationship between civilization and religion must undergo a fundamental revision.Â  ~Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion


Everyday people are straying away from the church and going back to God.Â  ~Lennie Bruce, The Essential Lennie Bruce, 1972

Why do children want to grow up?Â  Because they experience their lives as constrained by immaturity and perceive adulthood as a condition of greater freedom and opportunity.Â  But what is there today, in America, that very poor and very rich adolescents want to do but cannot do?Â  Not much:Â  they can "do" drugs, "have" sex, "make" babies, and "get" money (from their parents, crime, or the State).Â  For such adolescents, adulthood becomes synonymous with responsibility rather than liberty.Â  Is it any surprise that they remain adolescents?Â  ~Thomas Szasz

Huxley, "Biogenesis and Abiogenesis," The Royal Society President's Address to the Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Liverpool, Critiques and Addresses, 1870, Collected Essays VIII

How index-learning turns no student pale,

In all science, error precedes the truth, and it is better it should go first than last.Â  ~Hugh Walpole

Scientific principles and laws do not lie on the surface of nature.Â  They are hidden, and must be wrested from nature by an active and elaborate technique of inquiry.Â  ~John Dewey, Reconstruction in Philosophy, 1920

But in science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to the man to whom the idea first occurs.Â  ~Francis Darwin

It is the man of science, eager to have his every opinion regenerated, his every idea rationalized, by drinking at the fountain of fact, and devoting all the energies of his life to the cult of truth, not as he understands it, but as he does not yet understand it, that ought properly to be called a philosopher.Â  ~Charles Peirce

The most remarkable discovery made by scientists is science itself.Â  ~Gerard Piel

An experiment is a question which science poses to Nature, and a measurement is the recording of Nature's answer.Â  ~Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, 1949

Theory helps us bear our ignorance of facts.Â  ~George Santayana, The Sense of Beauty, 1896

In science it often happens that scientists say, "You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken," and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again.Â  They really do it.Â  It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful.Â  But it happens every day.Â  I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.Â  ~Carl Sagan, 1987

Physics isn't a religion.Â  If it were, we'd have a much easier time raising money.Â  ~Leon Lederman

The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.Â  ~Eden Phillpotts, A Shadow Passes

Ah, gravity: thou art a heartless bitch.Â  ~Robert Cohen, Chuck Lorre, and Bill Prady, The Big Bang Theory, "The Big Bran Hypothesis," original airdate 1 October 2007

My mother made me a scientist without ever intending to.Â  Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school, "So?Â  Did you learn anything today?"Â  But not my mother.Â  "Izzy," she would say, "did you ask a good question today?"Â  That difference - asking good questions - made me become a scientist.Â  ~Isidor Isaac Rabi

The effort to reconcile science and religion is almost always made, not by theologians, but by scientists unable to shake off altogether the piety absorbed with their mother's milk.Â  ~H.L. Mencken, Minority Report: H.L. Mencken's Notebook, 1956

Scientists, therefore, are responsible for their research, not only intellectually but also morally.Â  This responsibility has become an important issue in many of today's sciences, but especially so in physics, in which the results of quantum mechanics and relativity theory have opened up two very different paths for physicists to pursue.Â  They may lead us - to put it in extreme terms - to the Buddha or to the Bomb, and it is up to each of us to decide which path to take.Â  ~Fritjof Capra, The Turning Point, 1982

Not fact-finding, but attainment to philosophy is the aim of science.Â  ~Martin H. Fischer

There is no gravity.Â  The earth sucks.Â  ~Graffito

The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.Â  ~Isaac Asimov, Isaac Asimov's Book of Science and Nature Quotations, 1988

In every department of physical science there is only so much science, properly so-called, as there is mathematics.Â  ~Immanuel Kant

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.Â  ~Max Planck, A Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, 1949

The scientist, by the very nature of his commitment, creates more and more questions, never fewer.Â  Indeed the measure of our intellectual maturity, one philosopher suggests, is our capacity to feel less and less satisfied with our answers to better problems.Â  ~G.W. Allport, Becoming, 1955

The improver of natural science absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such.Â  For him, scepticism is the highest of duties:Â  blind faith the one unpardonable sin.Â  ~Thomas Henry Huxley, Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews, 1871

It is now quite lawful for a Catholic woman to avoid pregnancy by a resort to mathematics, though she is still forbidden to resort to physics and chemistry.Â  ~H.L. Mencken, "Minority Report," Notebooks, 1956

Heaven is on the other side of that feeling you get when you're sitting on the couch and you get up and make a triple-decker sandwich.Â  It's on the other side of that, when you don't make the sandwich.Â  It's about sacrifice....

If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins.Â  ~Benjamin Franklin

The value of identity of course is that so often with it comes purpose.Â  ~Richard Grant

Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue.Â  Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them.Â  And the point is, to live everything.Â  Live the questions now.Â  Perhaps you will find them gradually, without noticing it, and live along some distant day into the answer.Â  ~Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet

Learning to skip has brought control into her life.Â  Whenever she feels all sad, she switches into this wholly happy gait, sliding, hopping, and sliding again; when doing this, it seems as though her head separates from her body, making her feel dizzy and emptied out of bad thoughts.Â  Does anyone else know this trick, she wonders?Â  Probably not, although her Mother sometimes smiles and waves from the window.Â  ~Carol Shields, The Stone Diaries

Skipping is jumping for joy, step after step.Â  ~Terri Guillemets

Skipping isn't for everyone.Â  Getting out of our comfort zones for a momentary skipping escape takes guts.Â  It is much more difficult than many realize.Â  Our ego likes to feel in control and is afraid of what others will think....

There's another powerful benefit of skipping which is that it adds joy and positive energy to the world.Â  Seeing adults consumed by the joy of skipping sends a compelling message about the power of the spirit over fear.Â  When you learn to turn off your logical mind and get lost in the spirit of skipping, it's like exercising a muscle that will help you deal with other fears.Â  As external events become increasingly intense, that kind of inner strength will be more important than ever.Â  ~Kim Corbin, founder of iskip.com

If I had time for only two exercises, I would choose yoga and skipping.Â  ~Terri Guillemets

There was a boyishness about Mr. Clemens sometimes that found different modes of expression.Â  Once, when the long corridor of the second floor of the hotel presented a temptingly empty avenue, he hopped, skipped, and ran, and then gave a delicious suggestion of a cake-walk.Â  As soon as a door opened, however, he stopped and assumed a supernaturally grave aspect.Â  ~Elizabeth Wallace, Mark Twain and the Happy Island, 1914

Those moments before a poem comes, when the heightened awareness comes over you, and you realize a poem is buried there somewhere, you prepare yourself.Â  I run around, you know, kind of skipping around the house.Â  It's as though I could fly, almost, and I get very tense before I've told the truth - hard.Â  Then I sit down at the desk and get going with it.Â  ~Anne Sexton

The first time the duchess halted by my side, I whispered to her to calm her gushing spirits, not to meddle with her dress, and for public opinion's sake, not to step so high.Â  I said she could get over just as much ground at a moderate gait; and, beside the noble grand duke, her father, might happen along at any moment.Â  I might as well have talked to the wind.Â  She only laughed that characteristic laugh of hers that silvery laugh that I could recognize anywhere if I were to the leeward, and then, bending a little, she grabbed up the sides of her apparel with both hands, began to jerk it to and fro in a violent manner, threw her magnificent head back and skipped furiously away on an Irish jig step, all excitement, wild hilarity, distracted costume, frenzied motion!Â  A spectacle to seal the eye-balls and to astonish the soul of a hermit!Â  ~Mark Twain (unconfirmed), Atlanta Daily Constitution, 28 February 1878, "The Fascinating Duchess"

The repose of sleep refreshes only the body.Â  It rarely sets the soul at rest.Â  The repose of the night does not belong to us.Â  It is not the possession of our being.Â  Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms.Â  In the morning we must sweep out the shadows.Â  ~Gaston Bachelard

A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by
One after one; the sound of rain, and bees

Sleepless...

A little insomnia is not without its value in making us appreciate sleep, in throwing a ray of light upon that darkness.Â  ~Marcel Proust

It's at night, when perhaps we should be dreaming, that the mind is most clear, that we are most able to hold all our life in the palm of our skull.Â  I don't know if anyone has ever pointed out that great attraction of insomnia before, but it is so; the night seems to release a little more of our vast backward inheritance of instincts and feelings; as with the dawn, a little honey is allowed to ooze between the lips of the sandwich, a little of the stuff of dreams to drip into the waking mind.Â  I wish I believed, as J. B. Priestley did, that consciousness continues after disembodiment or death, not forever, but for a long while.Â  Three score years and ten is such a stingy ration of time, when there is so much time around.Â  Perhaps that's why some of us are insomniacs; night is so precious that it would be pusillanimous to sleep all through it!Â  A "bad night" is not always a bad thing.Â  ~Brian W. Aldiss

Sleep, that deplorable curtailment of the joy of life.Â  ~Virginia Woolf

The days are cold, the nights are long,

Without thee what is all the morning's wealth?
Come, blessed barrier between day and day,
Dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health!
~William Wordsworth, "To Sleep"

The amount of sleep required by the average person is five minutes more.Â  ~Wilson Mizener

There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness.Â  ~Charles Dickens

Smooth fields, white sheets of water, and pure sky;
I have thought of all by turns, and yet do lie
Sleepless!
~William Wordsworth

How do people go to sleep?Â  I'm afraid I've lost the knack.Â  I might try busting myself smartly over the temple with the night-light.Â  I might repeat to myself, slowly and soothingly, a list of quotations beautiful from minds profound; if I can remember any of the damn things.Â  ~Dorothy Parker

For sleep, one needs endless depths of blackness to sink into; daylight is too shallow, it will not cover one.Â  ~Anne Morrow Lindbergh

Cut if you will with sleep's dull knife

A smile costs nothing but gives much.Â  It enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give.Â  It takes but a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.Â  None is so rich or mighty that he cannot get along without it and none is so poor that he cannot be made rich by it.Â  Yet a smile cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away.Â  Some people are too tired to give you a smile.Â  Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.Â  ~Author Unknown

It takes a lot of work from the face to let out a smile, but just think what good smiling can bring to the most important muscle of the body... the heart.Â  ~Author Unknown

The greater the mental charlatan, the more definite his insistence on the wickedness and weaknesses of human nature.Â  Yet how can anyone speak of it today, with every soul in a prison, with every heart fettered, wounded, and maimed?...

I am not quite sure what the advantage is in having a few more dollars to spend if the air is too dirty to breathe, the water too polluted to drink, the commuters are losing out in the struggle to get in and out of the city, the streets are filthy, and the schools so bad that the young perhaps wisely stay away, and the hoodlums roll citizens for some of the dollars they saved in the tax cut.Â  ~John Kenneth Galbraith

Beggars should be abolished.Â  It annoys one to give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.Â  ~Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, "On the Pitying," Thus Spake Zarathustra

It's difficult to view the world outside our human context.Â  Staying alive and paying the bills both require our attention squarely fixed on our own business.Â  Our sprawling cities and suburbs are wonderful and frightening tributes to creative self-absorption.Â  In them, we spend our microscheduled days bustling between work and the endless details of our private lives, turning in our moments of rest to the buzzing distractions of television and computers - all accelerating toward some ultimate, unseen fulfillment of convenience and hyperreality.Â  Little encourages us to pause and look around, much less question the end goal of all our busyness.Â  Anything slower than the quick cuts of TV commercials is overwhelmed by our impatience and short attention.Â  Unfortunately, we might be missing something important - to our happiness and to our survival.Â  The purpose of this book is to help remind us.Â  ~From the introduction to The Sacred Earth: Writers on Nature & Spirit, edited by Jason Gardner, 1998, New World Library

Somehow among all our use of antibiotic medicine and antibacterial soap our souls are becoming sanitized as well - don't let it happen to you!Â  ~Brock Fiant

I always turn to the sports section first.Â  The sports section records people's accomplishments; the front page nothing but man's failures.Â  ~Earl Warren, quoted in Sports Illustrated, 22 July 1968

This strange disease of modern life, with its sick hurry, its divided aims.Â  ~Matthew Arnold

The quintessential revolution is that of the spirit, born of an intellectual conviction of the need for change in those mental attitudes and values which shape the course of a nation's development.Â  A revolution which aims merely at changing official policies and institutions with a view to an improvement in material conditions has little chance of genuine success.Â  Without a revolution in spirit, the forces which had produced inequities of the old order would continue to be operative, posing a constant threat to the process of reform and regeneration.Â  It is not enough merely to call for freedom, democracy and human rights.Â  There has to be a united determination to persevere in the struggle, to make sacrifices in the name of enduring truths, to resist the corrupting influences of desire, ill will, ignorance, and fear.Â  ~Aung San Suu Kyi

In solitude, where we are least alone.Â  ~George Gordon, Lord Byron, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage

Inside myself is a place where I live all alone, and that's where I renew my springs that never dry up.Â  ~Pearl Buck

Finding solitude in the concrete jungle is powerful and peaceful.Â  ~Mike Dolan, www.hawaiianlife.com

Sport is where an entire life can be compressed into a few hours, where the emotions of a lifetime can be felt on an acre or two of ground, where a person can suffer and die and rise again on six miles of trails through a New York City park.Â  Sport is a theater where sinner can turn saint and a common man become an uncommon hero, where the past and the future can fuse with the present.Â  Sport is singularly able to give us peak experiences where we feel completely one with the world and transcend all conflicts as we finally become our own potential.Â  ~George A. Sheehan

The Rock knew his wrestling career was over when he looked across the ring and saw his opponent... THE PAPER.Â  ~Jerry Thomas

Unlike any other business in the United States, sports must preserve an illusion of perfect innocence.Â  The mounting of this illusion defines the purpose and accounts for the immense wealth of American sports.Â  It is the ceremony of innocence that the fans pay to see - not the game or the match or the bout, but the ritual portrayal of a world in which time stops and all hope remains plausible, in which everybody present can recover the blameless expectations of a child, where the forces of light always triumph over the powers of darkness.Â  ~Lewis H. Lapham, Money and Class in America, 1988

Squash is boxing with racquets.Â  ~Jonah Barrington

Crystallizing my feelings about the game, I find that squash is less frustrating than golf, less fickle than tennis.Â  It is easier than badminton, cheaper than polo.Â  It is better exercise than bowls, quicker than cricket, less boring than jogging, drier than swimming, safer than hang gliding.Â  ~John Hopkins, Squash: A Joyful Game, 1980

My only feeling about superstition is that it's unlucky to be behind at the end of the game.Â  ~Duffy Daugherty

If I lose at play, I blaspheme; if my fellow loses, he blasphemes.Â  So, God is always the loser.Â  ~John Donne, 1623

We have forty-four defenses for him, but he has forty-five ways to score.Â  ~Al Attles, on Nate Archibald

Winning isn't overrated - it's your acceptance of being rated.Â  ~Carrie Latet

Sports are too much with us.Â  Late and soon, sitting and watching - mostly watching on television - we lay waste our powers of identification and enthusiasm and, in time, attention as more and more closing rallies and crucial putts and late field goals and final playoffs and sudden deaths and world records and world championships unreel themselves ceaselessly before our half-lidded eyes.Â  ~Roger Angell

Fans are the only ones who really care.Â  There are no free-agent fans.Â  ~Dick Young

I will not permit thirty men to travel four hundred miles to agitate a bag of wind.Â  ~Andrew Dickson White

Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play.Â  It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence:Â  in other words, it is war minus the shooting... there are quite enough real causes of trouble already, and we need not add to them by encouraging young men to kick each other on the shins amid the roars of infuriated spectators.Â  ~George Orwell

We can't win at home and we can't win on the road.Â  My problem as general manager is I can't think of another place to play.Â  ~Pat Williams

Hoe while it is spring, and enjoy the best anticipations.Â  It is not much matter if things do not turn out well.Â  ~Charles Dudley Warner

If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome.Â  ~Anne Bradstreet

The year's at the spring
And day's at the morn;
Morning's at seven;
The hillside's dew-pearled;
The lark's on the wing;
The snail's on the thorn;
God's in His heaven -
All's right with the world!

No miracle so strangely rare.
I wonder what will next be there!

To listen to Earth's weary voices
Louder every day
Bidding her no longer linger
On her charm'd way
But hasten to her task of beauty
Scarcely yet begun.
~Adelaide Anne Procter

The first day of spring was once the time for taking the young virgins into the fields, there in dalliance to set an example in fertility for nature to follow.Â  Now we just set the clocks an hour ahead and change the oil in the crankcase.Â  ~E.B. White, "Hot Weather," One Man's Meat, 1944

If, from the more wretched parts of the old world, we look at those which are in an advanced stage of improvement, we still find the greedy hand of government thrusting itself into every corner and crevice of industry, and grasping the spoil of the multitude.Â  Invention is continually exercised, to furnish new pretenses for revenues and taxation.Â  It watches prosperity as its prey and permits none to escape without tribute.Â  ~Thomas Paine

Question:Â  " I understand that Congress is considering a so-called 'flat' tax system.Â  How would this work?"Â  Answer:Â  "If Congress were to pass a 'flat' tax, you'd simply pay a fixed percentage of your income, and you wouldn't have to fill out any complicated forms, and there would be no loopholes for politically connected groups, and normal people would actually understand the tax laws, and giant talking broccoli stalks would come around and mow your lawn for free, because Congress is NOT going to pass a flat tax, you pathetic fool."Â  ~Dave Barry

It is very strange, this domination of our intellect by our digestive organs.Â  We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our stomach wills so.Â  It dictates to us our emotions, our passions.Â  After eggs and bacon it says, "Work!"Â  After beefsteak and porter, it says, "Sleep!"Â  After a cup of tea (two spoonfuls for each cup, and don't let it stand for more than three minutes), it says to the brain, "Now rise, and show your strength.Â  Be eloquent, and deep, and tender; see, with a clear eye, into Nature, and into life:Â  spread your white wings of quivering thought, and soar, a god-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath you, up through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!"Â  ~Jerome K. Jerome, Three Men in a Boat

Why do children want to grow up?Â  Because they experience their lives as constrained by immaturity and perceive adulthood as a condition of greater freedom and opportunity.Â  But what is there today, in America, that very poor and very rich adolescents want to do but cannot do?Â  Not much:Â  they can "do" drugs, "have" sex, "make" babies, and "get" money (from their parents, crime, or the State).Â  For such adolescents, adulthood becomes synonymous with responsibility rather than liberty.Â  Is it any surprise that they remain adolescents?Â  ~Thomas Szasz

Theatre is life.Â  Cinema is art.Â  Television is furniture.Â  ~Author Unknown

TV is the place where the pursuit of happiness has become the pursuit of trivia
Where toothpaste and cars have become sex objects
Where imagination is sucked out of children by a cathode ray nipple...
~The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, "Television, the Drug of the Nation" (song)

I believe television is going to be the test of the modern world, and that in this new opportunity to see beyond the range of our vision, we shall discover a new and unbearable disturbance of the modern peace, or a saving radiance in the sky.Â  We shall stand or fall by television - of that I am quite sure.Â  ~E.B. White

I have had my television aerials removed.Â  It is the moral equivalent of a prostate operation.Â  ~Malcolm Muggeridge

The cable TV sex channels don't expand our horizons, don't make us better people, and don't come in clearly enough.Â  ~Bill Maher

[T]elevision's perfect.Â  You turn a few knobs, a few of those mechanical adjustments at which the higher apes are so proficient, and lean back and drain your mind of all thought.Â  And there you are watching the bubbles in the primeval ooze.Â  You don't have to concentrate.Â  You don't have to react.Â  You don't have to remember.Â  You don't miss your brain because you don't need it.Â  Your heart and liver and lungs continue to function normally.Â  Apart from that, all is peace and quiet.Â  You are in the man's nirvana.Â  And if some poor nasty minded person comes along and say you look like a fly on a can of garbage, pay him no mind.Â  He probably hasn't got the price of a television set.Â  ~Raymond Chandler

If the television craze continues with the present level of programs, we are destined to have a nation of morons.Â  ~Daniel Marsh, 1950

Television hangs on the questionable theory that whatever happens anywhere should be sensed everywhere.Â  If everyone is going to be able to see everything, in the long run all sights may lose whatever rarity value they once possessed, and it may well turn out that people, being able to see and hear practically everything, will be specially interested in almost nothing.Â  ~E.B. White

The marvels - of film, radio, and television - are marvels of one-way communication, which is not communication at all.Â  ~Milton Mayer

Philo began laying out his vision for what television could become.Â  Above all else... television would become the world's greatest teaching tool.Â  Illiteracy would be wiped out.Â  The immediacy of television was the key.Â  As news happened viewers would watch it unfold live; no longer would we have to rely on people interpreting and distorting the news for us.Â  We would be watching sporting events and symphony orchestras.Â  Instead of going to the movies, the movies would come to us.Â  Television would also bring about world peace.Â  If we were able to see people in other countries and learn about our differences, why would there be any misunderstandings?Â  War would be a thing of the past.Â  ~Evan I. Schwartz, The Last Lone Inventor, about Philo T. Farnsworth, inventor of television

CNN, ESPN, ABC, TNT but mostly B.S... ~The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, "Television, the Drug of the Nation" (song)

If any reader of this book is in the grip of some habit of which he is deeply ashamed, I advise him not to give way to it in secret but to do it on television.Â  No-one will pass him with averted gaze on the other side of the street.Â  People will cross the road at the risk of losing their own lives in order to say "We saw you on the telly."Â  ~Quentin Crisp

Life doesn't imitate art, it imitates bad television.Â  ~Woody Allen

Tennis is not a gentle game.Â  Psychologically, it is vicious.Â  That people are only just beginning to come to terms with this fact illustrates just how big a con trick has been perpetrated on the non-playing tennis public - and even a few players, usually losing players - for decades.Â  ~Richard Evans


The cunning competitor plays on the other party's guilt.Â  Continuously praise your opponent's shots, and you'll notice how he begins to press.Â  Self-beratement also serves to balance a guilty conscience for being successful and makes your opponent disturbed for upsetting you so.Â  If on occasion you call one of your opponent's "out" shots "in," then later on you can innocently call an "in" shot "out" on a crucial play.Â  Practice saying "Good try," sincerely; then you can call a lot of close shots "out" and get away with it.Â  ~Theodor Saretsky

It's difficult for most people to imagine the creative process in tennis.Â  Seemingly it's just an athletic matter of hitting the ball consistently well within the boundaries of the court.Â  That analysis is just as specious as thinking that the difficulty in portraying King Lear on stage is learning all the lines.Â  ~Virginia Wade


It's one-on-one out there, man.Â  There ain't no hiding.Â  I can't pass the ball.Â  ~Pete Sampras

If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer.Â  But if he spends his days as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time, he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau

Trees are your best antiques.Â  ~Alexander Smith

A few minutes ago every tree was excited, bowing to the roaring storm, waving, swirling, tossing their branches in glorious enthusiasm like worship.Â  But though to the outer ear these trees are now silent, their songs never cease.Â  Every hidden cell is throbbing with music and life, every fiber thrilling like harp strings, while incense is ever flowing from the balsam bells and leaves.Â  No wonder the hills and groves were God's first temples, and the more they are cut down and hewn into cathedrals and churches, the farther off and dimmer seems the Lord himself.Â  ~John Muir

The tree is more than first a seed, then a stem, then a living trunk, and then dead timber.Â  The tree is a slow, enduring force straining to win the sky.Â  ~Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, The Wisdom of the Sands, translated from French by Stuart Gilbert

Alone with myself
The trees bend to caress me
The shade hugs my heart.

It is well that you should celebrate your Arbor Day thoughtfully, for within your lifetime the nation's need of trees will become serious. We of an older generation can get along with what we have, though with growing hardship; but in your full manhood and womanhood you will want what nature once so bountifully supplied and man so thoughtlessly destroyed; and because of that want you will reproach us, not for what we have used, but for what we have wasted.Â  ~Theodore Roosevelt, 1907 Arbor Day Message

Look at the trees, look at the birds, look at the clouds, look at the stars... and if you have eyes you will be able to see that the whole existence is joyful.Â  Everything is simply happy.Â  Trees are happy for no reason; they are not going to become prime ministers or presidents and they are not going to become rich and they will never have any bank balance.Â  Look at the flowers - for no reason.Â  It is simply unbelievable how happy flowers are.Â  ~Osho

I hear the wind among the trees
Playing the celestial symphonies;
I see the branches downward bent,
Like keys of some great instrument.
~Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Will urban sprawl spread so far that most people lose all touch with nature?Â  Will the day come when the only bird a typical American child ever sees is a canary in a pet shop window?Â  When the only wild animal he knows is a rat - glimpsed on a night drive through some city slum?Â  When the only tree he touches is the cleverly fabricated plastic evergreen that shades his gifts on Christmas morning?Â  ~Frank N. Ikard, North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference, Houston, March 1968

Death is a low chemical trick played on everybody except sequoia trees.Â  ~J.J. Furnas

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
~Joyce Kilmer, "Trees," 1914

But four arms to hug me, repay all my trouble.

If we would only give, just once, the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks' vacation, we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days.Â  ~Dorothy Canfield Fisher

Vanity dies hard; in some obstinate cases it outlives the man.Â  ~Robert Louis Stevenson

Virtue would not go to such lengths if vanity did not keep her company.Â  ~François de la Rochefoucauld


Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter, wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others who are within his sphere of action:Â  and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.Â  ~Benjamin Franklin


A vegetarian is a person who won't eat anything that can have children.Â  ~David Brenner

You put a baby in a crib with an apple and a rabbit.Â  If it eats the rabbit and plays with the apple, I'll buy you a new car.Â  ~Harvey Diamond

Dear Lord, I've been asked, nay commanded, to thank Thee for the Christmas turkey before us... a turkey which was no doubt a lively, intelligent bird... a social being... capable of actual affection... nuzzling its young with almost human-like compassion.Â  Anyway, it's dead and we're gonna eat it.Â  Please give our respects to its family.Â  ~Berke Breathed, Bloom County Babylon

If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian.Â  ~Paul McCartney

One farmer says to me, "You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make the bones with;" and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying himself with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau

How can you eat anything with eyes?Â  ~Will Kellogg

Being a meat eater is really expensive, even if you don't count the cost of chemo.Â  ~Snargleplexon.com

My situation is a solemn one.Â  Life is offered to me on condition of eating beefsteaks.Â  But death is better than cannibalism.Â  My will contains directions for my funeral, which will be followed not by mourning coaches, but by oxen, sheep, flocks of poultry, and a small traveling aquarium of live fish, all wearing white scarfs in honor of the man who perished rather than eat his fellow creatures.Â  ~George Bernard Shaw

My perspective of veganism was most affected by learning that the veal calf is a by-product of dairying, and that in essence there is a slice of veal in every glass of what I had thought was an innocuous white liquid - milk.Â  ~Rynn Berry, quoted in Joanne Stepaniak, The Vegan Sourcebook, 1998

Nothing spoils lunch any quicker than a rogue meatball rampaging through your spaghetti.Â  ~Jim Davis, "Garfield"Â  (Please note: In its original context, this is NOT about vegetarianism)

Thanksgiving dinner's sad and thankless
Christmas dinner's dark and blue
When you stop and try to see it
From the turkey's point of view.
~Shel Silverstein, "Point of View"

All normal people love meat.Â  If I went to a barbeque and there was no meat, I would say, "Yo Goober!Â  Where's the meat?"Â  I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa.Â  You don't win friends with salad.Â  ~Matt Groening, The Simpsons, spoken by the character Homer Simpson

Truely man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds theirs.Â  We live by the death of others:Â  we are burial places!Â  I have from an early age abjured the use of meat, and the time will come when men such as I will look on the murder of animals as they now look on the murder of men.Â  ~Leonardo da Vinci

I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other....Â  ~Henry David Thoreau, Walden, 1854

While we ourselves are the living graves of murdered beasts, how can we expect any ideal conditions on this earth?Â  ~George Bernard Shaw

I just could not stand the idea of eating meat - I really do think that it has made me calmer....Â  People's general awareness is getting much better, even down to buying a pint of milk:Â  the fact that the calves are actually killed so that the milk doesn't go to them but to us cannot really be right, and if you have seen a cow in a state of extreme distress because it cannot understand why its calf isn't by, it can make you think a lot.Â  ~Kate Bush

I think if you want to eat more meat you should kill it yourself and eat it raw so that you are not blinded by the hypocrisy of having it processed for you.Â  ~Margi Clark

"Thou shalt not kill" does not apply to murder of one's own kind only, but to all living beings; and this Commandment was inscribed in the human breast long before it was proclaimed from Sinai.Â  ~Leo Tolstoy

As soon as I realized that I didn't need meat to survive or to be in good health, I began to see how forlorn it all is.Â  If only we had a different mentality about the drama of the cowboy and the range and all the rest of it.Â  It's a very romantic notion, an entrenched part of American culture, but I've seen, for example, pigs waiting to be slaughtered, and their hysteria and panic was something I shall never forget.Â  ~Cloris Leachman

We manage to swallow flesh only because we do not think of the cruel and sinful thing that we do.Â  Cruelty... is a fundamental sin, and admits of no arguments or nice distinctions.Â  If only we do not allow our heart to grow callous, it protests against cruelty, is always clearly heard; and yet we go on perpetrating cruelties easily, merrily, all of us - in fact, anyone who does not join in is dubbed a crank.Â  ~Rabindranath Tagore

Can you really ask what reason Pythagoras had for abstaining from flesh?Â  For my part I rather wonder both by what accident and in what state of soul or mind the first man did so, touched his mouth to gore and brought his lips to the flesh of a dead creature, he who set forth tables of dead, stale bodies and ventured to call food and nourishment the parts that had a little before bellowed and cried, moved and lived.Â  How could his eyes endure the slaughter when throats were slit and hides flayed and limbs torn from limb?Â  How could his nose endure the stench?Â  How was it that the pollution did not turn away his taste, which made contact with the sores of others and sucked juices and serums from mortal wounds?Â  ~Plutarch

It is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion, and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust.Â  ~Percy Bysshe Shelley, Queen Mab Notes

Vegetarianism can easily reach religious proportions.Â  Refraining from meat on moral grounds serves to dignify feelings of guilt toward sad-eyed, furry creatures and substitutes righteousness for squeamishness.Â  ~Bill Griffith, Griffith Observatory comic strip, 1977

To my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being.Â  I should be unwilling to take the life of a lamb for the sake of the human body.Â  ~Mahatma Gandhi

A veteran USDA meat inspector from Texas describes what he has seen:Â  "Cattle dragged and choked... knocking 'em four, five, ten times.Â  Every now and then when they're stunned they come back to life, and they're up there agonizing.Â  They're supposed to be re-stunned but sometimes they aren't and they'll go through the skinning process alive.Â  I've worked in four large [slaughterhouses] and a bunch of small ones.Â  They're all the same.Â  If people were to see this, they'd probably feel really bad about it.Â  But in a packing house everybody gets so used to it that it doesn't mean anything."Â  ~Slaughterhouse 1997

I eat everything that nature voluntarily gives:Â  fruits, vegetables, and the products of plants.Â  But I ask you to spare me what animals are forced to surrender:Â  meat, milk, and cheese.Â  ~Author Unknown (Thanks, Eric)

Think of me tonite
For that which you savor
Did it give you something real,
or could you taste the pain of my death in its flavor?
~Wayne K. Tolson, from "Food Forethought"

Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.Â  ~Albert Einstein

I do not like eating meat because I have seen lambs and pigs killed.Â  I saw and felt their pain.Â  They felt the approaching death.Â  I could not bear it.Â  I cried like a child.Â  I ran up a hill and could not breathe.Â  I felt that I was choking.Â  I felt the death of the lamb.Â  ~Vaslav Nijinsky

Would you kill your pet dog or cat to eat it?Â  How about an animal you're not emotionally attached to?Â  Is the thought of slaughtering a cow or chicken or pig with your own hands too much to handle?Â  Instead, would hiring a hit-man to do the job give you enough distance from the emotional discomfort?Â  What animal did you put a contract out on for your supper last night?Â  Did you at least make sure that none went to waste and to take a moment to be grateful for its sacrifice?Â  ~Anonymous



But the freedom that they fought for, and the country grand they wrought for,
Is their monument to-day, and for aye.

How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
~William Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice, much later adapted to "So shines a good deed in a weary world" by David Seltzer for the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory


In the beginning of a change, the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned.Â  When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.Â  ~Mark Twain, Notebook, 1935


All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished.Â  ~Marshall Rosenberg

There is a great streak of violence in every human being.Â  If it is not channeled and understood, it will break out in war or in madness.Â  ~Sam Peckinpah

The man who strikes first admits that his ideas have given out.Â  ~Chinese Proverb

What broke in a man when he could bring himself to kill another?Â  ~Alan Paton

Who overcomes by force hath overcome but half his foe.Â  ~John Milton, Paradise Lost, 1667

There have been periods of history in which episodes of terrible violence occurred but for which the word violence was never used.... Violence is shrouded in justifying myths that lend it moral legitimacy, and these myths for the most part kept people from recognizing the violence for what it was.Â  The people who burned witches at the stake never for one moment thought of their act as violence; rather they thought of it as an act of divinely mandated righteousness.Â  The same can be said of most of the violence we humans have ever committed.Â  ~Gil Bailie

Violence in the voice is often only the death rattle of reason in the throat.Â  ~John Frederick Boyes

Let us thank God that we live in an age when something has influence besides the bayonet.Â  ~Daniel Webster

In violence we forget who we are.Â  ~Mary McCarthy

It is clear that the way to heal society of its violence... and lack of love is to replace the pyramid of domination with the circle of equality and respect.Â  ~Manitonquat

Thus the metric system did not really catch on in the States, unless you count the increasing popularity of the nine-millimeter bullet.Â  ~Dave Barry

It's not the bullet with my name on it that worries me.Â  It's the one that says "To whom it may concern."Â  ~Anonymous Belfast resident, quoted in London Guardian, 1991

I believe everybody in the world should have guns.Â  Citizens should have bazookas and rocket launchers too.Â  I believe that all citizens should have their weapons of choice.Â  However, I also believe that only I should have the ammunition.Â  Because frankly, I wouldn't trust the rest of the goobers with anything more dangerous than string.Â  ~Scott Adams

I will not carry a gun.... I'll carry your books, I'll carry a torch, I'll carry a tune, I'll carry on, carry over, carry forward, Cary Grant, cash and carry, carry me back to Old Virginia, I'll even hari-kari if you show me how, but I will not carry a gun!Â  ~Hawkeye, M*A*S*H, "Officer of the Day"

Force is all-conquering, but its victories are short-lived.Â  ~Abraham Lincoln

Why are sex and violence always linked?Â  I'm afraid they'll blur together in people's minds - sexandviolence - until we can't tell them apart.Â  I expect to hear a newscaster say, "The mob became unruly and the police were forced to resort to sex."Â  ~Dick Cavett, 1978

And so, to the end of history, murder shall breed murder, always in the name of right and honor and peace, until the gods are tired of blood and create a race that can understand.Â  ~George Bernard Shaw, "Caesar and Cleopatra"

It is the deed that teaches, not the name we give it.Â  Murder and capital punishment are not opposites that cancel one another, but similars that breed their kind.Â  ~George Bernard Shaw, Maxims for Revolutionists

The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual crime.Â  ~Max Stirner

Play allows us to develop alternatives to violence and despair.... ~Stuart Brown

So long as governments set the example of killing their enemies, private citizens will occasionally kill theirs.Â  ~Elbert Hubbard

He who loves the bristle of bayonets only sees in the glitter what beforehand he feels in his heart.Â  It is avarice and hatred; it is that quivering lip, that cold, hating eye, which built magazines and powder-houses.Â  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson

The moment a man claims a right to control the will of a fellow being by physical force, he is at heart a slaveholder.Â  ~Henry C. Wright, The Liberator, 7 April 1837

Man's destructive hand spares nothing that lives; he kills to feed himself, he kills to clothe himself, he kills to adorn himself, he kills to attack, he kills to defend himself, he kills to instruct himself, he kills to amuse himself, he kills for the sake of killing.Â  ~Josef de Maistre

How many does it take to metamorphose wickedness into righteousness?Â  One man must not kill.Â  If he does, it is murder.... But a state or nation may kill as many as they please, and it is not murder.Â  It is just, necessary, commendable, and right.Â  Only get people enough to agree to it, and the butchery of myriads of human beings is perfectly innocent.Â  But how many does it take?Â  ~Adin Ballou, The Non-Resistant, 5 February 1845

It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.Â  ~Gandhi

Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit.Â  You not only refuse to shoot a man, but you refuse to hate him.Â  ~Martin Luther King, Jr.

Nonviolence doesn't always work - but violence never does.Â  ~Madge Micheels-Cyrus

In some cases nonviolence requires more militancy than violence.Â  ~Cesar Chavez

We are double-edged blades, and every time we whet our virtue the return stroke strops our vice.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau

Virtue is insufficient temptation.Â  ~George Bernard Shaw


Beware of making your moral staple consist of the negative virtues.Â  ~Oliver Wendell Holmes,Â Jr.


Do not be too moral.Â  You may cheat yourself out of much life so.Â  Aim above morality.Â  Be not simply good; be good for something.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau


He that has energy enough to root out a vice should go further, and try to plant a virtue in its place.Â  ~Charles Caleb Colton


Modesty and unselfishness - these are virtues which men praise - and pass by.Â  ~AndrÃ© Maurois, Ariel, 1924

Virtue is its own revenge.Â  ~E.Y. Harburn


All of us are experts at practicing virtue at a distance.Â  ~Theodore M. Hesburgh

On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.Â  ~George Orwell

In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.Â  ~John Muir

Walking:Â  the most ancient exercise and still the best modern exercise.Â  ~Carrie Latet

The body's habituation to walking as normal stems from the good old days.Â  It was the bourgeois form of locomotion: physical demythologization, free of the spell of hieratic pacing, roofless wandering, breathless flight.Â  Human dignity insisted on the right to walk, a rhythm not extorted from the body by command or terror.Â  The walk, the stroll, were private ways of passing time, the heritage of the feudal promenade in the nineteenth century.Â  ~Theodor W. Adorno

An early-morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau

A dog is one of the remaining reasons why some people can be persuaded to go for a walk.Â  ~O.A. Battista

If I could not walk far and fast, I think I should just explode and perish.Â  ~Charles Dickens

As a nation we are dedicated to keeping physically fit - and parking as close to the stadium as possible.Â  ~Bill Vaughan

my rage, forgetting everything.

If you want to forget all your other troubles, wear too tight shoes.Â  ~The Houghton Line, November 1965

The Americans never walk.Â  In winter too cold and in summer too hot.Â  ~J.B. Yeats

I, who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring some rust, and when sometimes I have stolen forth for a walk at the eleventh hour of four o'clock in the afternoon, too late to redeem the day, when the shades of night were already beginning to be mingled with the daylight, have felt as if I had committed some sin to be atoned for.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau

The true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking, or in the scenery, but in the talking.Â  The walking is good to time the movement of the tongue by, and to keep the blood and the brain stirred up and active; the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in upon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and soul and sense; but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk.Â  ~Mark Twain

Hiking is just walking where it's okay to pee.Â  ~Demetri Martin

[Hiking] is the best workout!... You can hike for three hours and not even realize you're working out.Â  And, hiking alone lets me have some time to myself.Â  ~Jamie Luner

Don't let people drive you crazy when you know it's in walking distance.Â  ~Author Unknown

The night walked down the sky with the moon in her hand.Â  ~Frederick L. Knowles



Give me the money that has been spent in war and I will clothe every man, woman, and child in an attire of which kings and queens will be proud.Â  I will build a schoolhouse in every valley over the whole earth.Â  I will crown every hillside with a place of worship consecrated to peace.Â  ~Charles Sumner


War does not determine who is right - only who is left.Â  ~Bertrand Russell

A great war leaves the country with three armies - an army of cripples, an army of mourners, and an army of thieves.Â  ~German Proverb


The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience.Â  Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.Â  We know more about war that we know about peace, more about killing that we know about living.Â  ~Omar Bradley


Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.Â  This world in arms is not spending money alone.Â  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.Â  This is not a way of life at all in any true sense.Â  Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower, speech, American Society of Newspaper Editors, 16 April 1953


The most persistent sound which reverberates through men's history is the beating of war drums.Â  ~Arthur Koestler, Janus: A Summing Up


What a cruel thing is war:Â  to separate and destroy families and friends, and mar the purest joys and happiness God has granted us in this world; to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors, and to devastate the fair face of this beautiful world.Â  ~Robert E. Lee, letter to his wife, 1864


Everyone's a pacifist between wars.Â  It's like being a vegetarian between meals.Â  ~Colman McCarthy


Nations have recently been led to borrow billions for war; no nation has ever borrowed largely for education.Â  Probably, no nation is rich enough to pay for both war and civilization.Â  We must make our choice; we cannot have both.Â  ~Abraham Flexner

The problem in defense is how far you can go without destroying from within what you are trying to defend from without.Â  ~Dwight D. Eisenhower

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

I couldn't help but say to [Mr. Gorbachev], just think how easy his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another planet.Â  [We'd] find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this earth together.Â  ~Ronald Reagan, 1985


[John] Dalton's records, carefully preserved for a century, were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester.Â  It is not only the living who are killed in war.Â  ~Isaac Asimov

We have war when at least one of the parties to a conflict wants something more than it wants peace.Â  ~Jeane J. Kirkpatrick


Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities, War.Â  He is the only one that gathers his brethren about him and goes forth in cold blood and calm pulse to exterminate his kind.Â  He is the only animal that for sordid wages will march out... and help to slaughter strangers of his own species who have done him no harm and with whom he has no quarrel.... And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands and works for "the universal brotherhood of man" - with his mouth.Â  ~Mark Twain


Patriots always talk of dying for their country and never of killing for their country.Â  ~Bertrand Russell, attributed


It doesn't require any particular bravery to stand on the floor of the Senate and urge our boys in Vietnam to fight harder, and if this war mushrooms into a major conflict and a hundred thousand young Americans are killed, it won't be U.S. Senators who die.Â  It will be American soldiers who are too young to qualify for the Senate.Â  ~George McGovern


I'm fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in.Â  ~George McGovern

If it were proved to me that in making war, my ideal had a chance of being realized, I would still say "no" to war.Â  For one does not create a human society on mounds of corpses.Â  ~Louis Lecoin


War is fear cloaked in courage.Â  ~William Westmoreland


War is hell, but that's not the half of it, because war is also mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love.Â  War is nasty; war is fun.Â  War is thrilling; war is drudgery.Â  War makes you a man; war makes you dead.Â  ~Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried


War has a deeper and more ineffable relation to hidden grandeurs in man than has yet been deciphered.Â  ~Thomas de Quincey

What is absurd and monstrous about war is that men who have no personal quarrel should be trained to murder one another in cold blood.Â  ~Aldous Huxley

If you wish to be brothers, drop your weapons.Â  ~Pope John Paul II


Law never made men a whit more just; and by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice.Â  A common and natural result of an undue respect for law is that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, and all marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, ay, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart.Â  They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined.Â  Now, what are they?Â  Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power?Â  The mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies.... In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau, On the Duty of Civil Disobedience


Older men declare war.Â  But it is the youth that must fight and die.Â  ~Herbert Hoover


A day of battle is a day of harvest for the devil.Â  ~William Hooke

War should belong to the tragic past, to history:Â  it should find no place on humanity's agenda for the future.Â  ~Pope John Paul II (Karol Wojtyla)


Men were made for war.Â  Without it they wandered greyly about, getting under the feet of the women, who were trying to organize the really important things of life.Â  ~Alice Thomas Ellis


Will... the threat of common extermination continue?... Must children receive the arms race from us as a necessary inheritance?Â  ~Pope John Paul II, speech at the UN, 1979


War is nothing less than a temporary repeal of the principles of virtue.Â  It is a system out of which almost all the virtues are excluded, and in which nearly all the vices are included.Â  ~Robert Hall


Traditional nationalism cannot survive the fissioning of the atom.Â  One world or none.Â  ~Stuart Chase


Wars usually have the effect of speeding up the process of history.Â  ~Pieter Geyl, Debates With Historians


Why do we kill people who are killing people to show that killing people is wrong?Â  ~Holly Near


The pioneers of a warless world are the [youth] who refuse military service.Â  ~Albert Einstein


O Lord our God, help us tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it.Â  ~Mark Twain, "The War Prayer"


If you shoot one person you are a murderer.Â  If you kill a couple persons you are a gangster.Â  If you are a crazy statesman and send millions to their deaths you are a hero.Â  ~Author unknown, 1939 newspaper, see also "If only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy.Â  If millions die, that's only statistics" attribued to Joseph Stalin and "a single man killed is a misfortune, a million is a statistic" attributed to an anonymous Frenchman, 1948 (Thanks, Garson O'Toole!)


Men like war: they do not hold much sway over birth, so they make up for it with death.Â  Unlike women, men menstruate by shedding other people's blood.Â  ~Lucy Ellman


The effects of human wickedness are written on the page of history in characters of blood: but the impression soon fades away; so more blood must be shed to renew it.Â  ~Augustus William Hare and Julius Charles Hare, Guesses at Truth, by Two Brothers, 1827


War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.Â  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.Â  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.Â  ~John Stewart Mill


The aim of military training is not just to prepare men for battle, but to make them long for it.Â  ~Louis Simpson


The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his.Â  ~George Patton


The expendability factor has increased by being transferred from the specialised, scarce and expensively trained military personnel to the amorphous civilian population.Â  American strategists have calculated the proportion of civilians killed in this century's major wars.Â  In the First World War 5 per cent of those killed were civilians, in the Second World War 48 per cent, while in a Third World War 90-95 per cent would be civilians.Â  ~Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action


You can't say civilization don't advance, however, for in every war they kill you in a new way.Â  ~Will Rogers, New York Times, 23 December 1929


Organized slaughter, we realize, does not settle a dispute; it merely silences an argument.Â  ~James Frederick Green


I recoil with horror at the ferociousness of man.Â  Will nations never devise a more rational umpire of differences than force?Â  Are there no means of coercing injustice more gratifying to our nature than a waste of the blood of thousands and of the labor of millions of our fellow creatures?Â  ~Thomas Jefferson


War should be made a crime, and those who instigate it should be punished as criminals.Â  ~Charles Evans Hughes


War is a game which were their subjects wise, kings would not play at.Â  ~William Cowper


Borders are scratched across the hearts of men
By strangers with a calm, judicial pen,
And when the borders bleed we watch with dread
The lines of ink across the map turn red.
~Marya Mannes, Subverse: Rhymes for Our Times, 1959


War is not an adventure.Â  It is a disease.Â  It is like typhus.Â  ~Antoine de Saint-Exupery


They should pick a dry year to fight the war.Â  Better yet, civilize the moronic races and have no wars at all.Â  ~Clair J. Clark, letter to wife, March 1944


I don't know whether war is an interlude during peace, or peace an interlude during war.Â  ~Georges Clemenceau


As long as mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors, the thirst of military glory will ever be the vice of exalted characters.Â  ~Edward Gibbon


There's a graveyard in northern France where all the dead boys from D-Day are buried.Â  The white crosses reach from one horizon to the other.Â  I remember looking it over and thinking it was a forest of graves.Â  But the rows were like this, dizzying, diagonal, perfectly straight, so after all it wasn't a forest but an orchard of graves.Â  Nothing to do with nature, unless you count human nature.Â  ~Barbara Kingsolver, Animal Dreams


War!Â  When I but think of this word, I feel bewildered, as though they were speaking to me of sorcery, of the Inquisition, of a distant, finished, abominable, monstrous, unnatural thing.Â  When they speak to us of cannibals, we smile proudly, as we proclaim our superiority to these savages.Â  Who are the real savages?Â  Those who struggle in order to eat those whom they vanquish, or those who struggle merely to kill?Â  ~Guy de Maupassant, Sur l'Eau


The bomb that fell on Hiroshima fell on America too.Â  It fell on no city, no munition plants, no docks.Â  It erased no church, vaporized no public buildings, reduced no man to his atomic elements.Â  But it fell, it fell.Â  ~Hermann Hagedorn, "The Bomb That Fell on America"


I hate war for its consequences, for the lies it lives on and propagates, for the undying hatreds it arouses, for the dictatorships it puts in the place of democracies, and for the starvation that stalks after it.Â  I hate war, and never again will I sanction or support another.Â  ~Harry Emerson Fosdick


It seems like such a terrible shame that innocent civilians have to get hurt in wars, otherwise combat would be such a wonderfully healthy way to rid the human race of unneeded trash.Â  ~Fred Woodworth


In an incredible perversion of justice, former soldiers who sprayed festeringly poisonous chemicals on Vietnam, and now find today that they themselves have been damaged by them, appeal to the people for sympathy and charity.Â  The effects of the defoliant "Agent Orange" are discussed at length, but not one single newspaper article or hearing that we are aware of has even mentioned the effects of the people who still live in those regions of Vietnam.Â  It's as outlandish as if Nazis who gassed Jews were now to come forward and whine that the poisons they utilized had finally made them sick.Â  The staggering monstrousness goes unlaughed at and even unnoticed, as in a Kafka novel.Â  ~Fred Woodworth, The Match, No. 79


A visitor from Mars could easily pick out the civilized nations.Â  They have the best implements of war.Â  ~Herbert V. Prochnow


Studies by Medical Corps psychiatrists of combat fatigue cases... found that fear of killing, rather than fear of being killed, was the most common cause of battle failure, and that fear of failure ran a strong second.Â  ~S.L.A. Marshall


You're an old-timer if you can remember when setting the world on fire was a figure of speech.Â  ~Franklin P. Jones, referring to the atomic bomb

I find myself at the extremity of a long beach.Â  How gladly does the spirit leap forth, and suddenly enlarge its sense of being to the full extent of the broad, blue, sunny deep!Â  A greeting and a homage to the Sea!Â  I descend over its margin, and dip my hand into the wave that meets me, and bathe my brow.Â  That far-resounding roar is the Ocean's voice of welcome.Â  His salt breath brings a blessing along with it.Â  ~Nathaniel Hawthorne, "Foot-prints on the Sea-shore"

The lakes are something which you are unprepared for; they lie up so high, exposed to the light, and the forest is diminished to a fine fringe on their edges, with here and there a blue mountain, like amethyst jewels set around some jewel of the first water, - so anterior, so superior, to all the changes that are to take place on their shores, even now civil and refined, and fair as they can ever be.Â  ~Henry David Thoreau

The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic system, which is often identified with the fight-or-flight response, and the parasympathetic, which is identified with what's been called the relaxation response.Â  When you do yoga - the deep breathing, the stretching, the movements that release muscle tension, the relaxed focus on being present in your body - you initiate a process that turns the fight-or-flight system off and the relaxation response on.Â  That has a dramatic effect on the body.Â  The heartbeat slows, respiration decreases, blood pressure decreases.Â  The body seizes this chance to turn on the healing mechanisms.Â  ~Richard Faulds

It has long been my dream that one day Americans of all ages, creeds and colors will be practicing taijiquan in the parks of this nation as they do in China.Â  Few places in the world have such beautiful open spaces which can and should be used productively at no expense.Â  The result would be tremendous improvement in mental and physical well-being.Â  ~Jou, Tsung Hwa

Of all the exercises, I should say that T'ai Chi is the best.Â  It can ward off disease, banish worry and tension, bring improved physical health and prolong life.Â  It is a good hobby for your whole life, the older you are, the better.Â  It is suitable for everyone - the weak, the sick, the aged, children, the disabled and blind.Â  It is also an economical exercise.Â  As long as one has three square feet of space, one can take a trip to paradise and stay there to enjoy life for thirty minutes without spending a single cent.Â  ~T.T. Liang (Liang Tung-Tsai, 1900-2002), T'ai Chi Ch'uan for Health and Self-Defense

Think of the circular path of each movement, in Tai Chi every movement is in curve or circle that has no ending or beginning.Â  ~Paul Lam
